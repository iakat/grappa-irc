// #1584 — the ledger IS the cure, so it has to be able to fail for the right
// reason, and only for that reason. Runs under the cic vitest project (same
// reason and same shape as `fixtures/pushAbsence.test.ts`): the logic is
// deliberately free of any Playwright import, so it is provable without a
// testnet and without a browser.
//
// The case that matters is the one MEASURED on #1543: a spec whose outcome
// depends on paying the cold browser launch goes GREEN the moment any other
// spec sorts before it in the same project, and nothing in the report says
// the condition changed. A green like that is indistinguishable, to a reader,
// from a green that means the contract holds.
