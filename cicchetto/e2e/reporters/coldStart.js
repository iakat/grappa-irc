// #1584 — the driver half of the cold-start cure. Everything that is a
// DECISION lives in `coldStartLedger.ts` and is proven by vitest; this file
// only turns Playwright's reporter callbacks into that decision's input, and
// its answer into stdout plus a run status.
//
// Registered in `playwright.config.ts`, so it runs on EVERY invocation —
// full suite, `--grep`, single file, iso-rerun. That is the point: the
// invocations that silently change the input are exactly the scoped ones.
