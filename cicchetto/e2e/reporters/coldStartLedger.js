// #1584 — the decision half of the cold-start reporter, kept free of any
// Playwright import so `coldStartLedger.test.ts` can prove it without a
// testnet and without a browser.
//
// ## What lies, and why documenting it would not have been enough
//
// The suite runs `workers: 1`, `fullyParallel: false`, three projects. Exactly
// one test per worker pays the browser launch; every later test in that
// worker runs against an already-running browser. So "did this test pay the
// cold start?" is an INPUT to the test — decided by filename sort order plus
// which files the invocation collected — and until now it appeared nowhere in
// the result.
//
// Measured on #1543: `issue310-scroll-to-bottom-btn-cursor.spec.ts`'s @webkit
// test is RED 4/4 as the first `@webkit` test collected, and GREEN the moment
// one other `@webkit` spec sorts before it. A bare open with no assertions is
// red on the same seat. In the full 759-test suite it passes, behind dozens of
// earlier files. Nothing in either report says which side it was measured on.
//
// A green like that cannot be told apart from a green that means the contract
// holds, and a red like that reads as a regression in the branch when it is a
// property of the collected subset. Writing that down in a doc moves the
// problem to a file nobody opens while reading a tick.
//
// ## What this measures, and what it infers
//
// MEASURED: the first test each Playwright worker began, from the reporter's
// own `onTestBegin` stream — which sees every test, including the 29 spec
// files that import `test` from `@playwright/test` instead of the wrapped
// `fixtures/test`. A per-worker counter inside a fixture cannot see those, so
// a subset that puts one of them first would make the next wrapped test read
// as cold when it is not. That false reading is the reason the cure is a
// reporter and not a fixture.
//
// INFERRED: that the worker's first test is the one that paid the browser
// launch. Playwright launches the browser lazily, when a test first asks for
// it, so a hypothetical browser-less first test would push the launch onto its
// successor. No such spec exists today; the inference is named here rather
// than hidden, and the census wording states the measured fact.
//
// ## The two declarations
//
// A spec that knows its outcome depends on this input says so with a tag, and
// the run FAILS when the input does not match the declaration. Undeclared
// specs are never failed by this ledger — they get the census, which is the
// value of the input published next to their result.
/** A spec whose contract is only exercised on its worker's first test. */
