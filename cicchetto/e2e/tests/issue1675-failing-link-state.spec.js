// #1675 — `connection_state: "failing"`, the fourth state.
//
// The defect: `Networks.connect/1` writes `:connected` when the SPAWN
// succeeds, and nothing walked the row back when the upstream TCP/TLS/
// registration then failed. Three networks added on prod on 2026-08-22
// showed as connected in cicchetto while none of them ever registered.
// vjt's ruling made e2e coverage mandatory *because every part of it that
// failed on prod failed BETWEEN the layers* — an API-only assertion does
// not discharge the requirement, so the second half of test 1 asserts what
// the operator actually sees.
//
// SUBJECT: `admin-vjt`, the ONE seeded user with no network bind
// (compose.yaml: "admin-vjt has no bind"). Its HomePane therefore renders
// exactly the ephemeral network these tests provision and nothing else, so
// neither test can disturb — or be disturbed by — the seeded sessions every
// other spec depends on. The seeded networks are load-bearing and are never
// touched here (same discipline as admin-network-crud.spec.ts).
//
// DRIVER: a `network_servers` row pointed at a CLOSED port. `connect/2`
// returns `:econnrefused` immediately, `Session.Server`'s
// `{:irc_connect_failed, _}` arm reports `{:failing, "connection refused"}`
// through the injected `link_state_reporter`, and the row lands on
// `:failing` with the cause in `connection_state_reason`. Deterministic and
// instant — unlike the three real prod causes (a TLS hostname mismatch, an
// A-only host against a v6 source, a 30s connect timeout), which the
// harness cannot reproduce without a second ircd and a wall-clock wait.
//
// WHY TWO TESTS. The two halves of the ruling want opposite topologies:
//
//   1. `:failing` + the cic display want a PERMANENT failing row — one
//      dead server, so every attempt on the backoff ladder fails and the
//      state is stable for as long as the assertions take.
//   2. The recovery edge wants the row to LEAVE `:failing` on its own.
//      `SessionPlan`'s `refresh_plan` closure re-resolves the endpoint at
//      `Backoff.failure_count` on every `:transient` respawn, and
//      `Servers.pick_server!/2` indexes the enabled ring by that ordinal
//      (`rem(attempt, length(ring))`) — so a ring of [dead, dead, live]
//      walks itself onto the live leaf at attempt 2 and registers. That is
//      the REAL `mark_failing → mark_registered` pair on one credential,
//      not a park→connect cycle (which would re-write `:connected` from
//      `Networks.connect/1` before any registration and assert nothing).
//
// The two dead leaves in test 2 are not padding — see the ladder below.
//
// 🔴 THE LADDER, AND WHY THE BUDGETS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. These numbers are
// measured, not padding, and the first run of this spec was red for exactly
// this reason (polled 20s, needed ~35s).
//
// The FIRST connect failure never marks the row. Every operator-initiated
// connect spawns BEFORE it writes `:connected` (`resolve → spawn →
// Networks.connect/1`, which is #642's cure), so the row still reads
// `:parked` when an instantly-refusing upstream reports back, and
// `mark_failing/2` rejects `:parked` by design. Measured on the integration
// stack 2026-08-22 — `credential_bound` at 21:49:35.464, `report_link_state:
// {:failing, "connection refused"} declined (user_parked)` at .466, two
// milliseconds later. See `Networks.mark_failing/2`'s "KNOWN HOLE" section
// and DESIGN_NOTES 2026-08-22 #1675; it is a real bounded window, not a test
// artefact, and it is deliberately NOT cured in this slice.
//
// So the row can only reach `:failing` on attempt 2, which lands at
// `@connect_failure_sleep_ms` (30_000, `config/config.exs`; the e2e stack
// boots MIX_ENV=dev) + one backoff rung (5_000 ±25% jitter,
// `:session_backoff`) ≈ 35s. Test 2's ring then needs one more full rung
// before the live leaf: 2×30s + a 5s rung + a 10s rung + registration ≈ 95s.
//
// Shrinking the throttle in `config/dev.exs` was considered FIRST (the house
// rule is deterministic setup over a raised timeout, and #671 already does
// exactly that for the auto-away debounce) and declined on two grounds: it
// changes the retry cadence of every session in a 760-test suite to save 30s
// in one spec, and it would not buy determinism anyway — the wait exists
// because of the `:parked` window, not because of the throttle. There is no
// operator verb that provokes a connect failure on a row that is ALREADY
// `:connected`, so the wait cannot be removed from the test side.
//
// The polls below are therefore condition-based (poll until the state, never
// sleep-then-assert) with ceilings taken from that ladder.
//
// NOT COVERED HERE, deliberately: the reboot arm of the ruling (a
// `:failing` row is resumed by Bootstrap, not skipped). Restarting the
// container mid-suite is heavy and flaky; that arm runs the real
// `Bootstrap.run/0` against a real socket in
// `test/grappa/bootstrap_test.exs` ("#1675 — resumes a :failing
// credential").
