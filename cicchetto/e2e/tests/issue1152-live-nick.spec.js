// #1152 — the fixture's nick and the session's nick are two different
// things, and the suite only ever knew the first one.
//
// `provisionSpecSubject` asks for `nick: <name>`. If that nick is taken at
// the moment the session registers, #676's fallback ladder
// (`auth_fsm.ex`) re-registers as `<name>_` — and then as two random
// suffixes — with nothing raised: grappa even writes the substitution into
// the scrollback in plain words. `specNick()` kept answering `<name>`, so
// every `privmsg(specNick(), …)` in the suite addressed a nick the subject
// did not hold. The DM went to whoever DID hold it, the spec's own
// assertion timed out, and the failure looked like a flake.
//
// In the wild the trigger is a RACE: the nick is held by the previous
// test's not-yet-reaped ghost. This spec DISPLACES that trigger — a
// squatter takes the nick deliberately while the session is parked — so
// the same 433 arrives on every run instead of on unlucky ones. The race
// itself is not reproduced here and is not claimed to be.
//
// What is pinned, in order:
//   1. pre-state — requested and live agree, and the live reading is
//      OBSERVABLE (without this the divergence below could be read as
//      "these two never agreed", and the guard in `fixtures/test.ts` could
//      be vacuous without anybody noticing);
//   2. the divergence — after the squatted registration the live nick is
//      NOT the requested one;
//   3. that `specLiveNick()` follows it, product-side: a DM addressed to
//      the live nick lands in the subject's scrollback;
//   4. that a DM addressed to the REQUESTED nick does not — asserted only
//      after (3) has fired, so the absence is a measurement and not an
//      empty read (#1336's rule).
