// #1088 — an informational modal must open only on the client that asked.
//
// Reported by an operator running an IRC client in front of their own grappa:
// every `/who` the client issued opened the WHO modal in cicchetto, on a
// device that had asked for nothing. The cause was structural, not cosmetic —
// every one of these replies (`who_reply`, `names_reply`, `whois_bundle`,
// `whowas_bundle`, `server_reply`, `banlist_bundle`, `links_bundle`) was
// broadcast on `grappa:user:{name}`, a topic that partitions by SUBJECT and
// has no per-connection dimension. One question, a modal on every device.
//
// The fix addresses the reply to the connection that issued the command
// (`Grappa.PubSub.Topic.socket/2`), so this spec needs TWO clients of the
// SAME account — one asking, one watching. A single-page spec cannot see the
// defect at all: the asking client was always served correctly.
//
// Anti-hollow-green: "the bystander shows no modal" is worthless if the
// bystander is simply dead. So the bystander must PROVE it is live and
// receiving on the very same account, by rendering a channel message that
// arrives after the /who — and still show no modal.
//
// Barrier: the asking client's modal is the durable signal that the server
// produced and delivered the reply. Both deliveries would ride the same
// server-side fan-out, so once the asker has rendered it, a bystander that
// was going to receive it has already been sent it.
