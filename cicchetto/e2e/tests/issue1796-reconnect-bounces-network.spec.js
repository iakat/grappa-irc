// #1796 — `/reconnect [<network>] [<reason>]`: the NETWORK bounce, irssi's
// RECONNECT. One verb where the operator used to type two, and the second of
// those two made them spell out a slug the client already knew.
//
// What makes this spec discriminating is that BOTH legs leave a signal, and
// neither signal is a transient the assertion has to catch mid-flight:
//
//   PARK — selection.ts's UX-4 bucket D redirects to Home the moment a
//   network the operator is looking at transitions INTO `:parked`. That
//   redirect is one-way: nothing sends them back. So "the operator ends on
//   Home" is durable proof that the park leg fired, readable long after it
//   did. A `/reconnect` that quietly skipped the park would leave the
//   operator in the channel and this assertion fails.
//
//   UNPARK — the network ends CONNECTED, with NO click. That is the whole
//   difference from `/disconnect` (cp15-b6-parked-disconnect-reconnect, which
//   has to click the Home card's Reconnect chip to get here). A `/reconnect`
//   that only parked would leave the section greyed and the parked card up.
//
// Deliberately NOT asserted: that the sidebar is greyed BETWEEN the legs. It
// is, but only for as long as the bounce takes, and pinning a state the
// implementation is racing to leave is how a spec becomes a flake detector for
// testnet latency instead of a regression detector for this verb.
//
// Also not asserted: the reason reaching upstream as the QUIT message. It is
// only visible to OTHER users on the channel, and the park-leg
// `connection_state_reason` that IS visible here is cleared by the unpark leg
// (`Networks.connect/1` clears the prior reason by contract). The reason
// riding the park body is pinned in the unit suite instead
// (compose.test.ts, "/reconnect <net> <reason> carries the reason into the
// park leg only").
//
// Timeout: 90s. The body itself is seconds, but the afterEach settle polls up
// to 30s for SpawnOrchestrator → connect → SASL → autojoin → NAMES, and the
// bounce inside the body pays that cost once already.
