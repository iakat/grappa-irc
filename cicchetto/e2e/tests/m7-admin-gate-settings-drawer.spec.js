// M-cluster M-7 — the admin-gated door + admin pane skeleton.
//
// #986 — that door is no longer the settings drawer. The drawer's "admin
// console" entry was an exact duplicate of the rail's 🔧 admin launcher (same
// isAdmin() gate, same setSelectedChannel payload, same destination) and was
// deleted; the gate itself is unchanged, so this spec keeps its name and its
// job and simply asserts it on the surviving surface. Filename kept
// deliberately: six sibling specs cross-reference it as THE M-7 gate spec.
//
// Three-class parity matrix per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`:
// admin-gated is the EXEMPT shape — only ONE class (admin user) sees
// the surface. The spec still loops the three classes to assert the
// OPPOSITE polarity (non-admin user + visitor see NO admin launcher +
// can't open the admin pane).
//
// Visitor sub-case: visitors can't easily be seeded into the e2e
// harness today (no per-test visitor mint API; the captcha + Turnstile
// gate complicates it). The visitor branch is covered by the vitest
// unit at RailActions.test.tsx (isAdmin() false → launcher unmounted;
// SettingsDrawer.test.tsx pins that no drawer copy survived); the
// Playwright spec covers the two seeded
// user classes (vjt non-admin, admin-vjt admin). The vitest pin is
// the load-bearing assertion for visitors; Playwright is the
// production-fidelity confirmation for the gate logic.
//
// Per `feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke`: this spec exercises the
// real CSS render path that vitest jsdom can't — the admin launcher
// needs to be visible (display, opacity, transform) inside the
// expanded RailActions menu, which is absolutely positioned, capped by
// a JS-measured max-height and overlays the members list.
