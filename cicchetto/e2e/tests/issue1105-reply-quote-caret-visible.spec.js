// inside one PRIVMSG so the server-side split budget (#246) never turns it
// into two scrollback rows. #1277 raised the cap to 100 and left the filler
// alone: the posted body runs 161 code points with the timestamp, still 61
// past the cap, and the overflow below was measured rather than assumed.

// this spec needs is therefore built the way an operator builds it — the reply
