// #1759c — does a CROSS-USER reconnect storm saturate the connection pool,
// and if so at what N?
//
// ## Why this exists, and why it could not be an Elixir test
//
// #1759's working premise was that one account with W windows produces W
// SIMULTANEOUS `join_reply` computations. That premise is dead: the transport
// blocks inside one join until the channel answers
// (`phoenix/lib/phoenix/socket.ex:739` → `channel/server.ex:40-52`, a bare
// `receive` with ZERO `after` → `:315-319`, which replies only after
// `join/3` returns). Per CONNECTION there is at most ONE join in flight.
//
// But every connection has its OWN transport process, and the pool is a NODE
// resource. So if the saturation is real it has to be CROSS-USER — N distinct
// subjects reconnecting together — and nobody has measured that.
//
// `Phoenix.Test.ChannelTest` cannot answer it: it pins `transport_pid: self()`
// and calls `Channel.Server.join/4` straight from the test process, so it
// reports "serial" by construction whatever the truth is. An instrument that
// cannot fail earns no green. This needs REAL, CONCURRENT WebSockets, which
// is why it lives here and drives raw sockets in a page (the same move
// `issue95-ws-token-subprotocol.spec.ts` makes) rather than booting N copies
// of cic — the server cannot tell the two apart, and N browser contexts would
// buy nothing but wall-clock.
//
// ## What is measured, and with what
//
// No new instrumentation. `Grappa.DbLatency` already accumulates Ecto's
// `queue_time` and counts `contention.queue_timeout` — a checkout the pool
// could not serve, which IS saturation rather than a proxy for it — and
// `GrappaWeb.Admin.DbLatencyController` already exposes both with a reset.
// The cycle is reset → drive the burst → snapshot.
//
// ## Displacement, not correlation
//
// Two levers move, and the reading must follow them or the hypothesis dies:
//
//   * **N** (concurrent subjects) — stepped over a ladder inside one run;
//   * **`pool_size`** — 5 and 10, supplied by the harness through
//     `POOL_SIZE` (see the `#1759c` lever in `config/dev.exs`). If the
//     saturation point tracks the pool, the mechanism is the pool. If it does
//     not move, the pool is not the bottleneck and that is a RESULT.
//
// A single reading at a single pool size cannot separate those two, which is
// the whole reason the lever was added.
//
// ## Declared limits — read these before quoting any number
//
//   * **The per-join cost here is a FLOOR.** The windows these sockets join
//     carry no seeded scrollback and no read cursor, so `join_reply/2` does
//     less arithmetic than a real window does (the same caveat
//     `GrappaWeb.JoinSeedCostTest`'s cheap arm carries). Saturation seen at
//     the floor is a strong positive; saturation NOT seen at the floor does
//     not clear a seeded storm.
//   * **The host is noisy** — this machine permanently carries unrelated
//     load. That is a limit on the numbers, and it is NOT offered as an
//     explanation of them.
//   * **N is bounded by what the testnet tolerates**, not by the question.
//     If the ladder runs out before saturation, the report says so; it does
//     not extrapolate.
