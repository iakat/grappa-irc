// U-cluster U-Z — full cap-honesty operator journey end-to-end.
//
// Covers the shipping reality of the entire U cluster (U-0..U-6) as a
// single composed REST journey. Mirrors M-Z's shape (one spec, one
// `try/finally` cap-restore) but stays REST-only by design: the
// browser-rendered surfaces (cic banners + Networks tab live counters
// + admin Sessions cap-count summary) are exhaustively smoked by the
// per-bucket specs (u-3-cap-honesty-mapping for Sessions tab summary,
// m10-admin-networks-cap-editor for the Networks tab editor, M-Z for
// the admin-events fan-out). Re-driving them here would duplicate
// per-bucket coverage without adding new signal — per
// `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`, U-Z is the cross-bucket
// COMPOSITIONAL spec, not a re-run of every guarded surface.
//
// The U-narrative this spec pins:
//
//   Step 1. Park vjt's seeded session so /connect re-spawns through
//           admission (admission gates only on fresh spawn).
//   Step 2. Admin saturates the USER cap (=0) and the user-flow
//           /connect rejects with 503 `network_busy` (U-0 spawn-first
//           contract + U-2 subject-aware admission + U-3 FC mapping).
//   Step 3. DB row stays at the prior `:parked` state — U-0's
//           spawn-first/commit-second invariant. Pre-U-0 the row
//           would have flipped to `:connected` and the post-fail row
//           would be a phantom-connected. The PATCH 503 response IS
//           the boundary observation but we also verify GET
//           /admin/networks/:slug reflects the row's pre-PATCH cap
//           configuration unchanged (no half-write).
//   Step 4. Admin bumps user cap to 1; vjt /connect succeeds 200.
//           (Bumping mid-cluster mirrors the plan's "admin opens
//           console → bumps cap" step.)
//   Step 5. Visitor-cap independence: admin sets visitor cap=0,
//           leaves user cap=10, vjt /connect SUCCEEDS — visitor
//           saturation never blocks operator login (UD1 split).
//
// Step 4 (logout visitor → user same client_id), Step 5 (visitor
// /quit slot freed), Step 6 (capacity_reject admin event lands),
// Step 8 (iptables connect-timeout phase smoke) — see
// "Why four plan items are documented but not driven" below.
//
// Per `feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke`: this spec doesn't drive
// chromium (no `page` fixture). U-cluster surfaces are server-side
// admission decisions + FC mappings; the visual smoke for cic
// renderings is covered per-bucket in u-3 + u-5 specs (both DO drive
// chromium for their respective surfaces).
//
// Why four plan §U-Z items are documented but not driven:
//
//   - **Step 4 (logout visitor → login user same client_id)** +
//     **Step 5 (visitor /quit frees slot)**: now driven by
//     `u-4-device-identity-change.spec.ts` (cluster e2e-revive-skips
//     fixed the seeder TLS default that was blocking visitor mint;
//     u-4 was reactivated with a real test body). U-Z does not
//     re-assert Step 4/5 because u-4 covers the cross-kind cap
//     contract at the HTTP boundary plus unit-level tests at
//     admission_test.exs + auth_controller_test.exs cover the
//     synchronous-logout invariant.
//
//   - **Step 6 (capacity_reject admin event lands live)**: covered
//     end-to-end by `m-z-admin-cluster-journey.spec.ts` (the M cluster
//     close spec already drives PATCH cap=0 → mint visitor → assert
//     event row in Events tab in real time). Duplicating the same
//     fan-out path here against the user-flow /connect-reject would
//     re-exercise the same `Admission.Telemetry → AdminEvents.record
//     → broadcast` plumbing without adding a new signal — the U-3
//     FC mapping difference (network_busy vs too_many_sessions) is
//     covered by u-2-admission-split + u-3-cap-honesty-mapping
//     respectively at the wire boundary.
//
//   - **Step 8 (iptables DROP → :connect_timeout phase smoke)**:
//     infeasible in the e2e harness. iptables DROP requires
//     NET_ADMIN capability inside the test container, plus
//     coordinated routing changes to the testnet leaf. The
//     per-phase typed errors (`:connect_timeout` vs
//     `:welcome_timeout` vs `:probe_timeout`) are unit-tested
//     at `test/grappa/visitors/login_test.exs` (UD7 mock-based
//     phase-boundary assertions) — the timeout split has a unit
//     test for each phase boundary, and the FallbackController
//     mapping has integration coverage. The remaining e2e
//     observation would be "real Bahamut + slow rDNS produces
//     :welcome_timeout typed error" which only the live operator
//     can actually trigger (and which the production deploy
//     post-U-2 has already proven on raccooncity.azzurra.chat).
//
// Pre-seeded state:
//   - vjt (user) bound to bahamut-test with `#bofh` autojoin
//     (seedData).
//   - vjt's Session.Server is live at spec start (Bootstrap spawn +
//     autojoin completed during e2e harness boot).
//
// afterEach restores ALL caps to permissive (nil = unlimited) AND
// restores vjt to :connected so subsequent specs see the seeder
// baseline. Mirrors u-2 + u-3 cleanup pattern.
