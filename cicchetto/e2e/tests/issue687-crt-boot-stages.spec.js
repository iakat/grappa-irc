// issue687-crt-boot-stages — the CRT splash must say WHICH boot stage it
// is waiting on. Before #687 it showed the same five static lines during
// a healthy 200 ms boot and during a stall, three of them asserting
// subsystems were "OK" while the boot sat on a fetch. The user could not
// tell "still loading" from "dead"; a self-hoster's installed PWA hung on
// that screen every first launch.
//
// WHAT THIS PINS, and why it is not satisfiable by a component that
// merely exists: every assertion reads the RENDERED TEXT of a stage line
// and pairs it with the resource state that produced it. Two directions,
// because only both together are a real proof —
//
//   * a register hard-coded to "done" passes an "is it visible?" check
//     and fails `assertPending` here;
//   * a register hard-coded to pending passes `assertPending` and fails
//     `assertDone` in the second test.
//
// FROZEN BOOT, not a natural one: the splash is the Shell main-pane
// `<Switch fallback>`, alive only until the boot resources settle. We
// hold a stage open with a never-resolving `page.route`, the technique
// crt-splash-font.spec.ts (#180) already uses. PENDING, not aborted: an
// aborted resource ERRORS and Solid re-throws it on read, which trips
// BootErrorBoundary and replaces the splash.
//
// BUDGET: #717's `bootFetch` bounds each boot GET at 8 s and retries
// twice (500 ms + 2 s backoff), so a hung route yields ~26.5 s of splash
// before the boundary takes over. Every assertion below must land inside
// the FIRST attempt's 8 s — hence the explicit short timeouts. If a
// future change to BOOT_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS shortens that, this spec goes
// red rather than silently asserting against the failure screen.
