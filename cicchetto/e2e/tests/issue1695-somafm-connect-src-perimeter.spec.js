// #1695 — the CSP perimeter around the SomaFM catalogue host.
//
// TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS AN EXUNIT QUESTION.
// `security_headers_test.exs` proves the policy STRING carries the token.
// It cannot prove a browser honours it, and it cannot prove what the policy
// still REFUSES. This spec answers both against the real header the BEAM
// serves, which is the only place the two can be checked together.
//
// THE REFUSALS ARE THE POINT. `connect-src` ships the measured host and
// nothing wider — measured against the live catalogue on 2026-08-23, all 184
// `.pls` playlist URLs (the only kind a client fetches, so the only kind
// `connect-src` governs) are on `api.somafm.com`, with the 138 logos on
// `img-src https:` and the 103 prerolls on `media-src https:`. So two
// neighbours of the allowed host must stay blocked, and they are blocked for
// DIFFERENT reasons:
//
//   * the BARE `somafm.com` — the trap #1695 names in its own verification.
//     The catalogue answers byte-identically from either host (measured:
//     52,852 bytes for `channels.json`, 2,576 for `songs/groovesalad.json`,
//     both hosts), so a client author reaching for the shorter spelling gets
//     a working `curl` and a blocked `fetch`. This pins the refusal so that
//     mistake reds here instead of in a browser console.
//
//   * `ice.somafm.com` — a somafm SUBDOMAIN that is not the API. THIS is the
//     one that catches a distracted widening to `https://*.somafm.com`, and
//     the bare domain does NOT: a CSP host-source spelled `*.` requires at
//     least one label, so `*.somafm.com` refuses the bare domain too and a
//     bare-domain pin would sail straight through the widening it was added
//     to catch. A non-api subdomain is the only stimulus that separates the
//     shipped policy from the wildcard.
//
// INTERCEPTION, NOT THE NETWORK. All three hosts are routed, so no assertion
// here depends on somafm being up (#682 made that rule for the station table
// and it holds harder for a gate). The renderer enforces CSP BEFORE the
// request reaches the network layer, so a route handler firing is itself the
// verdict "the policy let this out", and a handler that never fires is the
// verdict "the policy refused it". The `securitypolicyviolation` events
// collected by `fixtures/test.ts` are the second, independent witness. Hosts
// are routed one literal at a time rather than through a `*.somafm.com`
// glob — the glob is the very shape under test, and spelling it in the
// harness would make the harness agree with a widened policy by definition.
//
// The fulfilled response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` because the
// real endpoint does (measured, and recorded in `radioStations.ts`). Without
// it the browser would refuse the RESPONSE for CORS and the fetch would
// reject exactly as a CSP block does — two different failures wearing the
// same TypeError. `hits` is what keeps them apart: it records the request
// leaving the renderer, which is the CSP verdict on its own.
