// #1262 — channel MODE rows fold into the denoise filter, own-nick mode rows
// on `$server` do not.
//
// `:mode` was carved OUT of the suppressed set by #458 on the rule "the broad
// presence/control kinds carry operator-relevant signal and MUST stay
// visible". vjt withdrew that rule on 2026-08-13, so `:mode` is now the fifth
// plain kind in `Grappa.Scrollback.Message.suppressed_presence_kinds/0` and in
// cic's `SUPPRESSED_PRESENCE_KINDS`.
//
// ## What this e2e owns vs what the unit tests own
//
// The SET membership is pinned in `test/grappa/scrollback/message_test.exs` and
// `src/__tests__/presenceFilter.test.ts`, and the two languages are held equal
// by the parser gate in `test/grappa/presence_filter_test.exs`. The `$server`
// resolve-to-SHOW rule is pinned in
// `test/grappa/presence_filter/resolver_test.exs`. None of those can see the
// VISIBLE outcome, which is what this spec owns:
//
//   1. a channel MODE row renders, then DISAPPEARS the moment the channel is
//      denoised (the cic render filter), and
//   2. it is still gone after a RELOAD — i.e. the SERVER omitted it from the
//      cold-load page, not merely cic hiding it. This is the half that would
//      regress if only one side of the mirror moved; and
//   3. the own-nick `$server` mode row SURVIVES the same reload, because
//      `$server` has no member count and resolves to SHOW.
//
// A content row rides along throughout as the load witness: it proves the
// page is populated, so "0 mode rows" means folded rather than "nothing
// loaded yet" (an empty pane would satisfy the mode assertion vacuously).
//
// ## Why the spec creates its own channel
//
// `/join` on a fresh name makes the seeded user the channel creator, hence
// chanop, hence able to set `+m` — the same trick #240 uses for the mode
// modal. On a shared autojoin channel the user may not be op, and bahamut
// only echoes a MODE it actually applied, so a non-op attempt would hang to
// timeout rather than fail (feedback: the witness must be SERVED by the ircd).
//
// Anti-hollow-green: `/umode -i` in `finally` restores the shared seeded
// session's umode set so sibling specs do not inherit `+i` (mirrors #229).
//
// Desktop project (untagged → chromium; NO @webkit).
