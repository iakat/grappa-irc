// #382 — RFC1459 comma-separated multi-channel JOIN, proven end-to-end
// against the live upstream.
//
// cic already forwards `/join #a,#b` as ONE comma-list POST
// (slashCommands.ts join handler: sigil'd lists pass through unsplit).
// Pre-#382 the SERVER's single-channel validator rejected the comma so the
// whole join died. #382 makes the server honor it: split, validate +
// canonical-fold each element, send ONE multi-target JOIN line, and open a
// :pending → :joined window per channel.
//
// A hollow spec that only checked a single row would pass on the pre-#382
// single-channel path. This asserts BOTH sidebar rows exist AND that each is
// actually JOINED — `selectChannel` with `ownNick` requires the per-channel
// self-JOIN line + the WS-ready seam, which only a resolved :joined window
// satisfies (a greyed :pending / :failed window never renders the self-JOIN
// nor stamps channelReady). That proves the multi-target JOIN reached
// upstream and both channels resolved from ONE command.
//
// vjt creates two fresh per-run channels via ONE `/join #x,#y` (→ sole op of
// each) and PARTs both in `finally`. jsdom/vitest cannot do this — it needs
// the live ircd multi-target JOIN round-trip.
