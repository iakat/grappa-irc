// #310 — the floating scroll-to-bottom BUTTON must persist the read cursor and
// must NOT snap back to the unread divider ~2s later. Regression of #233.
//
// ## The bug (vjt prod report, recurring on Libera #libera)
//
// Tapping the floating scroll-to-bottom button jumped the view to the newest
// message, then ~2s later the view SNAPPED BACK up to the read marker — the read
// cursor was not persisted at the bottom. A MANUAL scroll to the bottom persists
// fine; only the button was affected.
//
// ## Root cause (cicchetto-side, two coupled defects)
//
// The button's onClick (and the #243 re-tap) funnelled through the pure
// `scrollToBottom()` helper, which only scrolls + sets `atBottom(true)`. Unlike a
// manual scroll it did NOT:
//   (a) POST a read-cursor advance — the manual path advances via the input-gated
//       scroll-settle, and a button tap never arms that gate (the button is a
//       sibling OUTSIDE `.scrollback`, so no pointerdown/wheel/touchmove lands on
//       the listRef). So "read to newest" never persisted (candidate a).
//   (b) release the marker-activation latch — a channel activation into an unread
//       window leaves `markerActivationPending` set; only operator INPUT or an own
//       send cleared it. With it still set, the NEXT rows() recreation (a live
//       message, or the switch-time refreshScrollback) re-asserted the marker jump
//       → the ~2s snap-back.
//
// #310 routes the button + re-tap through `scrollToBottomGesture`, which does both:
// clears the latch and advances the cursor to the newest rendered id (read AFTER
// the instant scroll via the shared forward-only setCursorIfAdvances path).
//
// ## What this spec pins (RED pre-#310, GREEN post)
//
//   (1) PERSISTENCE — the core "POST fired with the newest id": after the tap the
//       SERVER read cursor advances from the mid seed to the tail. Deterministic,
//       peer-free. RED pre-#310: the button never POSTed → the cursor stays at the
//       seed → the poll times out.
//   (2) NO SNAP-BACK — the visible symptom: a peer line arriving AFTER the tap
//       recreates rows() (the exact ~2s trigger on a busy channel). With the latch
//       released the pane tail-follows and STAYS at the bottom. RED pre-#310: the
//       latch was still set → the length-effect re-jumped to the divider.
//
// Two axes, one behaviour (mirror #243): DESKTOP (chromium, re-uses the #168
// 800×300 harness so the 50-row REST page overflows) + MOBILE (@webkit, iPhone 15
// device viewport). Playwright WebKit ≠ real iOS scroll physics
// (feedback_playwright_webkit_not_ios_scroll), so the @webkit run is the layout/
// touch CONTRACT, not a device-physics repro; the deterministic cursor-persist
// assertion is the authoritative mechanism proof on both.
