// #973 — the unread badge on a QUERY window must clear when the operator
// reads it, and STAY clear.
//
// Reported on 0.13.1: in a DM the badge only ever grew. Channels were fine.
// The cursor map was written under the peer nick in the casing the window
// wears (`query_windows.target_nick` is case-preserving server-side, and
// `canonicalQueryNick` resolves a selection to that spelling — it is not a
// fold) and read back under the ASCII-FOLDED name the badge memo decodes out
// of a `ChannelKey`. Two keys, one map. The only writer that ever landed the
// folded key was the `/me` cold load, so the count was right at page load and
// wrong forever after. Fixed by folding inside `readCursor.ts`'s `cacheKey` —
// the single door every cursor writer and reader already passes through.
//
// Why this spec exists on top of the vitest boundary tests
// (src/__tests__/queryUnreadBadgeCasing.test.ts): those drive the store's
// entry points directly and prove the KEYS agree. They cannot prove the pill
// leaves the screen. The reported symptom is a number the operator can see, so
// the witness has to be the rendered badge, reached through the real settle
// path (open the window, read, leave) rather than a synthetic cursor write.
// Per feedback_ux_e2e_mandatory: every cic UX-touching change ships one.
//
// RED proof (pre-fix): assertion 3 fails — after reading and leaving the query
// the badge still reads "1", because the leave-settle cursor landed on
// `azzurra I973Peer` while the memo kept asking `azzurra i973peer`. Assertion 5
// then reads "2" instead of "1", which is the monotonic growth vjt reported.
//
// The peer nick is deliberately MIXED CASE — that is the whole bug. A
// lowercase peer would fold to itself and the spec would pass on broken code.
// bahamut preserves nick casing, and `IrcPeer` reconciles `peer.nick` from the
// authoritative 001 (#604), so every locator below is derived from the nick
// the server actually registered, never from the constant we asked for.
