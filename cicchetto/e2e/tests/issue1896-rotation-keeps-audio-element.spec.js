// #1896 — rotating a phone across the 768px breakpoint must not re-tune the radio.
//
// Reported from a Galaxy S24 Ultra: with a station playing, every rotation —
// both directions — drops the audio for a fraction of a second and then starts
// it again on its own. The mechanism is not audio at all, it is the shell:
// `isMobile()` is `matchMedia("(max-width: 768px)")` and Shell branches on it
// with a `<Show>`, i.e. TWO complete subtrees rather than one laid out two ways.
// A phone whose landscape CSS width clears 768 flips that signal when it turns,
// Solid destroys one subtree and builds the other, and the player used to be
// mounted inside BOTH — so the `<audio>` on the far side was a different
// element. Its open effect then ran as a first tune, and for a STREAM
// `mustRefetch()` is true (#1700: a stream has no position to resume to,
// re-tuning IS its resume), so it re-fetched: a new HTTP connection, heard as
// the gap, with the autoplay behind the "restarts on its own".
//
// WHAT THIS SPEC MEASURES, and why each instrument is here.
//
//   * ELEMENT IDENTITY, marked rather than inferred. A rebuilt `<audio>` is
//     indistinguishable from the original by tag, testid or property — only a
//     mark written onto the live object before the crossing separates them, and
//     the element is what holds the connection.
//   * THE TRANSPORT CALLS, counted from an init script. Identity alone would
//     still pass if something re-assigned `.src` on the surviving element, and
//     `.src` is what re-opens the connection: assigning it re-invokes the media
//     load algorithm even for an unchanged URL. So the two are counted and must
//     not move across a crossing.
//
// And three controls, because each of them is a way for this to go green while
// proving nothing:
//
//   * the counters must be NON-ZERO before the first crossing — an instrument
//     that never fired reports "unchanged" perfectly;
//   * the shell must actually have SWITCHED branch at every crossing, asserted
//     on the root class — a resize that stays on one side of 768 changes
//     nothing and would satisfy every assertion below;
//   * the bar must be back on screen AFTER each crossing. An element that
//     survives into a shell with no transport driving it is not the fix.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH, stated because the green is easy to over-read.
// Not a device rotation: this is `setViewportSize` in desktop Chromium, so it
// reproduces the BREAKPOINT CROSSING (the same `matchMedia` edge, the same JSX
// flip) and not an orientation change on a handset. The S24 Ultra's real
// landscape CSS width was never read off the handset either — 844x390 below is
// a phone-shaped viewport chosen to straddle 768, not a measurement of the
// reporter's device. The desktop project is deliberate: the defect is in the
// shell's regime signal and its DOM, neither of which is touch- or
// engine-specific, and the untagged project is where the login/rail helpers
// this spec leans on are proven.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK, the #682/#1701 posture: the stream is served from
// local bytes by `page.route`, scoped to the station's real URL so a change
// that stops requesting it fails here rather than passing quietly.
