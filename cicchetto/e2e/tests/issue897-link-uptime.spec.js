// #897 — the server-info card's "connected <duration>" must measure the LIVE
// IRC link, and must say nothing when there is no live link to measure.
//
// Mezmerize reported `connected 10d 9h` on an instance he was power-cycling
// daily for upgrades. The card read the credential's
// `connection_state_changed_at`, which answers a different question: when the
// ROW last changed state. `Networks.connect/1` returns without a DB write on
// an already-`:connected` row, and a restart deliberately never parks the
// credential, so that column sails through restarts the socket does not.
//
// The fix moves the anchor to `connection.connected_at` — `Session.Server`'s
// per-process stamp, inside the live-only `connection` sub-object of
// `GET /networks`. Two consequences, and this spec asserts BOTH over the real
// stack because only the real stack can produce the divergence:
//
//   1. On a live link the duration renders — proving the new anchor actually
//      travels Session.Server → wire → store → DOM, which jsdom cannot show.
//   2. With the pid stopped and the DB row left at `:connected`, the card
//      keeps reporting the DB-canonical state and reports NO duration. This
//      is the discriminator: the OLD code renders a duration here, computed
//      from a column the terminate did not touch. It is also the CLAUDE.md
//      DB-vs-live rule made visible — divergence is shown, not smoothed over.
//
// Subject choice: a freshly minted VISITOR, not a seeded user. The spec has
// to kill a session to create the divergence, and a throwaway visitor is the
// one subject whose death poisons no downstream spec on the serial stack
// (`feedback_e2e_real_login_poisons_shared_stack`); it is reaped in `finally`.
//
// Desktop viewport → the rail column is permanent (#71 INC-2), no drawer
// dance. Sibling coverage: `issue474-server-info-rail.spec.ts` (the card's
// other rows), `ServerInfoCard.test.tsx` (the pure rendering rule).
