// Issue #1225 — /notice must reach the wire as a NOTICE and self-echo in the
// SOURCE window, opening no window for the recipient.
//
// Before #1225 the verb did not exist: `/notice nick text` fell through to the
// unknown-command error, and the only way out was `/quote NOTICE nick :text`
// (hand-typed trailing colon, no echo at all). The send half now mirrors #640's
// CTCP routing — echo keyed to the window it was typed in, recipient carried in
// meta.notice_target — with a NOTICE on the wire and a `:notice` row kind.
//
// Two things only a real stack can prove, and this is the acceptance gate for
// both (feedback_ux_e2e_mandatory):
//   1. the WIRE VERB. A PRIVMSG implementation renders an identical echo; the
//      only witness that distinguishes them is a live peer seeing `NOTICE` on
//      its socket. jsdom cannot see a socket.
//   2. the echo landing in the source window against a real persist +
//      broadcast, rather than a stubbed store.
