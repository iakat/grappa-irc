// #1308 — the admin Sessions list had no sort at all: the order was the
// merge's assembly order (visitors, then credentials, then orphan pids)
// and the operator could not change it. vjt asked for asc/desc on last
// active / last joined / last seen, default last joined desc.
//
// jsdom already covers the comparator and the rendered row order
// (`adminSubjectRows.test.ts`, `AdminSessionsTab.test.tsx`). What only a
// real stack can show is that the two halves are wired to REAL data: the
// row set is assembled from three live endpoints, and `last joined` for a
// user row comes from a credential field that was on the wire all along
// and reached no row until this change. A comparator fed a null it should
// have been fed a timestamp still sorts — it just sorts everything to the
// bottom, and the unit tests hand it the value directly.
//
// The oracle is a DISPLACEMENT, not an absolute position: the stack is
// shared and other specs mint visitors of their own, so "my row is first"
// is a claim about their timing rather than about the sort. What cannot
// be explained away is one pair of rows swapping places when the
// direction flips, and the pair is chosen so the sort has to disagree
// with the assembly order to be right — the visitor is minted NOW, so it
// is the newest subject on the table, while the merge assembles visitors
// BEFORE users.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: admin-gated EXEMPT.
