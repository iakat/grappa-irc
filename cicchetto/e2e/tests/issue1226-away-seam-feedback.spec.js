// #1226 — /away and its un-away twin were silent in the client. compose.ts's
// "away" case returns `{ok: true}` (a SILENT success, ComposeBox.tsx:515), so
// the only cue was the 💤 sidebar badge — a STATE indicator, and off-screen on
// a phone with the sidebar collapsed. This spec pins the acknowledgement the
// operator actually looks at: a line in the feedback seam under the compose
// box, on BOTH transitions.
//
// Drives the real round-trip, exactly as #276 does for the badge: `/away
// :reason` over the user-level Phoenix Channel → GrappaChannel.handle_in
// ("away") → Session.set_explicit_away → `AWAY :reason` upstream → bahamut
// replies 306 RPL_NOWAWAY → EventRouter's typed `away_confirmed` effect →
// broadcast on Topic.user → cic's awayStatus store → the seam. Bare `/away`
// unsets → 305 RPL_UNAWAY → away_confirmed(present) → the second line.
//
// The trigger is the SERVER echo, not the local push resolving (vjt's ruling,
// 2026-08-11), which is why the assertion below is worth its fake-lag wait: a
// seam fed by the local ack would light up even when the ircd never confirmed.
//
// Severity is the GREEN notice register (#356): class `compose-box-notice`,
// `role=status`. The red `compose-box-error` MUST NOT appear — an away
// acknowledgement is not a failure. Copy is state-ONLY (no reason echoed, no
// tally — the #1108 precedent), pinned here against ComposeBox.tsx's
// AWAY_SET_NOTICE / AWAY_UNSET_NOTICE.
//
// CLEANUP: afterEach clears away iff the badge is still up (failure path), so
// a mid-run failure does not leave the seeded session away for the next spec.
