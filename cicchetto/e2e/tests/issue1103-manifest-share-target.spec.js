// #1103 — the served PWA manifest must declare a file `share_target`, and it
// must accept exactly what the upload endpoint accepts (2026-08-09).
//
// WHY a served-manifest-contract spec and NOT a share-the-file spec: the
// behaviour is not headlessly e2e-able. The share sheet is an OS surface,
// the registration is minted into an Android WebAPK, and Playwright can
// neither install one nor invoke Android's share intent. What CAN be proved
// headlessly is the FIX ARTIFACT — that the manifest nginx actually serves
// off the built dist carries the declaration, with the method, encoding and
// accept list a Chromium install needs to offer cicchetto at all. Same
// posture, and the same reasoning, as the #234 orientation guard next door.
//
// The accept list is the part worth pinning. It is DERIVED in the build from
// `src/lib/uploadCategory.ts`, which is a declared 1:1 mirror of the server's
// `@mime_categories` — the closed allowlist that answers 415. A hand-edit
// that widens the manifest without widening the server would make the OS
// offer cicchetto for a file the upload endpoint then refuses, after the app
// has already opened. This spec reads the SERVED artifact, so it fails on
// that drift rather than on a source-level pin that could agree with itself.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION, not a gap in this spec: on Android the registration lives
// in the WebAPK, which is Chromium machinery. A PWA installed from Firefox
// will not appear in the system share sheet no matter what this manifest
// says. Nothing headless can observe that either way.
// Bare @playwright/test (NOT ../fixtures/test): a stateless static-asset
// probe must skip the vjt-scoped fixture and its per-test reset — same
// reasoning as issue234-manifest-no-orientation-pin.spec.ts.
