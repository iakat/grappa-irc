// Media-link modal viewer (2026-06-11) — e2e for the on-click in-app
// viewer for same-origin media URLs.
//
// Why: own upload URLs (`📸 https://host/uploads/<slug>`) are
// SAME-ORIGIN and the PWA manifest has no `scope` key, so they're
// in-PWA-scope — iOS standalone navigates them IN PLACE: raw media
// document, zero browser chrome, no back control; returning reloads
// cic. The viewer intercepts the click and renders the media inside
// cic instead (vjt-approved spec 2026-06-10; on-CLICK only, no
// on-arrival rendering — the text-only invariant bans previews, not
// click-to-view). Cross-origin links are untouched: out-of-scope →
// iOS Safari view → already correct.
//
// The full vertical reuses the UX-6-B embedded-upload journey (real
// POST /api/uploads, real IRC echo, real bytes served back) and then
// drives the NEW click path. This all runs under the REAL prod CSP —
// the BEAM emits it via GrappaWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders and the e2e
// dumb proxy forwards it byte-for-byte (#485; verified + pinned by
// nginx-csp-range-parity.spec.ts, e2e CSP parity 2026-06-11), and the
// `_cspGuard` fixture fails any spec whose journey trips a
// `securitypolicyviolation`. So `naturalWidth > 0` here proves both
// that the bytes came through the proxy AND that the CSP admits the
// modal's media element.
//
// NOT covered here: the iOS-standalone x-safari-https href rewrite of
// "open in browser" (dogfood fix 2026-06-11). The gate is
// isIos() && isStandalonePwa() — false in every Playwright project,
// and webkit emulation doesn't reproduce standalone-PWA navigation
// anyway (feedback_playwright_webkit_not_ios_scroll, same class).
// Unit tests pin the rewrite; device dogfood is the final word.
