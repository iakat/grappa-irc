// #1223 — what an admin row card does on a phone, once #1157 turned rows
// into cards.
//
// vjt, dogfooding staging on an iPhone: *"abbiamo tap target solo sul testo
// quando invece dovrebbe esser tutta l'area, parlo ad es dei nomi visitor"*
// and *"poi abbiamo quest'idiozia di mostrare colonne già mostrate"*.
// Separate defects behind those readings, all of them layout, all therefore
// invisible to jsdom (`feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke`) and to every
// vitest suite that mounts these components:
//
//   2. `.adm-row-expand` puts the 44px `--tap-min` floor on HEIGHT only and
//      sizes its box with `inline-flex`, so the door to the row's detail is
//      the caret + badge + nick run and the rest of the card's heading is
//      dead space that looks tappable. Asserted by TAPPING that dead space
//      and requiring the panel to open — the visible outcome, not the
//      declarations that produce it.
//
//   3. `.adm-facts` sizes its label track from the LONGEST label, so on a
//      393px screen the value track keeps well under half the width and
//      wraps timestamps over several lines. Asserted as the value track
//      taking the panel's full width, with the label above it.
//
//   1. the detail panel repeats fields the card already shows. vjt ruled the
//      fork on 2026-08-11 — *"1223 punto 1: direi drop no?"* — so the columns
//      really leave the card and the panel stays the only place they live.
//
//      Two defects share that symptom, and only ONE of them is in this file.
//      The `.adm-col-detail` specificity failure (Users, Credentials) is a
//      question about what is PAINTED, invisible to jsdom, so it is asserted
//      here. The Sessions repeat is JSX — `detailFacts` carried a `network`
//      fact while the identity cell printed the slug at every width, desktop
//      included — which vitest sees perfectly well and
//      `AdminSessionsTab.test.tsx` pins. Bringing it here too would buy a
//      slower copy of a test that already exists.
//
//      Also asserted here: the 769-899 BAND. The console's card regime starts
//      at 900px and `isMobile()` is 768px, so a fix that only raised the CSS
//      selector would have made that band strictly worse — columns gone,
//      `AdminRowName` still a plain span, no door to the panel they went
//      into. That is a real-browser claim as much as the drop is.
//
// The desktop test is the counter-claim, and it is why item 3's fix is a
// `@container` rule rather than a blanket single column: at a width where two
// columns fit, two columns are what the operator gets. Without it, collapsing
// unconditionally would pass.
//
// Sessions is the tab under test because its disclosure is `alwaysOpenable`
// (#1157), so the SAME control can be measured at both widths. The button is
// `AdminRowName`, which every tab routes identity through.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: admin-gated, the EXEMPT shape.
