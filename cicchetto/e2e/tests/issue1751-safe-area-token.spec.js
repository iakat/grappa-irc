// #1751 — the safe-area top inset reaches the radio picker's band through its
// ANCESTOR, exactly once, on both form factors.
//
// This spec is what caught the real defect, and it caught it by failing. The
// first reading of #1751 was that the symptom could not exist — the picker is
// `position: absolute; inset: 0` inside `.shell-members`, that aside insets
// itself, so the picker must already be clear. This spec's MOBILE arm returned
// a 0px delta and killed that argument: padding on a container is invisible to
// its abspos descendants, because the containing rectangle is the padding EDGE
// and INCLUDES the padding. The clearance now sits on the drawer's `top`, which
// moves the border box and every child with it.
//
// The desktop arm passes by a DIFFERENT mechanism and always did: there the
// aside is a grid item of the inset `.shell`, so its border box moves. Keeping
// both arms is the point — one mechanism per form factor, and only one of them
// was broken.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM, and the same answer #913 found. Playwright
// synthesizes `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on NO engine — they resolve to 0, and
// the `webkit-iphone-15` project is `devices["iPhone 15"]`, a viewport and a
// touch flag, not a notch. So no absolute claim about a 59px inset can be
// honest here. What IS observable is the WIRING: measure the same band twice,
// once at the Playwright value and once with the inset stubbed, and assert it
// moved by exactly that much.
//
// EXACTLY is the whole point, and it is what makes this more than a #913
// clone. `>= STUB` would pass on a build that insets the picker AS WELL as its
// ancestor — the regression the issue asked for, which lands the band a full
// inset too low with nothing red. `=== STUB` fails on both sides: 0 if the
// inset never reaches the picker, 2× if it reaches it twice.
//
// The stub goes through `--safe-area-inset-top`, and that indirection is what
// #1751 generalized: before it, `.shell` and `.shell-members` wrote `env()`
// inline and this spec could not have been written at all — the delta would be
// 0 on a correct build and on a broken one alike.
//
// BOTH CHAINS, because they are different. On mobile the picker's ancestor is
// the fixed `.shell-members` drawer carrying its own inset; on desktop it is a
// grid child of the inset `.shell`. `isMobile()` is a `matchMedia` width query
// (lib/theme.ts), so a viewport resize crosses the same 768px breakpoint the
// stylesheet does and both chains are reachable from one project. The felt
// result on a notched device is still vjt's to confirm; this spec does not
// claim it.
