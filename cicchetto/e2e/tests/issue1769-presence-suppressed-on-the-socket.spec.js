// Issue #1769 — presence suppressed by join params, measured ON THE SOCKET.
//
// WHY THIS SPEC EXISTS AND WHY IT LOOKS AT FRAMES
//
// #1680 already stops a paused channel from APPLYING peer join/part/quit: the
// events cross the socket, get decoded, wake the main thread, and are dropped
// at cic's dispatch edge. So the obvious end-to-end assertion — "the member
// list does not move on a paused channel" — is green with or without #1769.
// It would be a spec that cannot fail for the reason it was written.
//
// What #1769 buys is the thing #1680 could not: the bytes never arrive. That
// is only observable at the transport, so this spec counts WebSocket frames
// (`page.on("websocket")` → `framereceived`, the same instrument
// `issue375-rehash-option.spec.ts` and `i2b-image-upload-litterbox-host.spec.ts`
// use) and asserts on which ones are absent.
//
// THE CONTROLS, BECAUSE AN ABSENCE PROVES NOTHING BY ITSELF
//
// "No frame arrived" is also what a broken fixture, a peer that never joined,
// and a dead socket look like. Three positive controls run in the same page,
// against the same peer, on the same socket:
//
//   1. BEFORE the pause, a peer JOIN on the very same channel DOES produce a
//      frame. Same topic, same event, same everything — only the pause differs.
//   2. AFTER the pause, the FOCUSED channel still receives its peer JOIN. The
//      suppression is per-channel, not per-socket, and this is the arm that
//      fails if the whole socket went quiet.
//   3. AFTER the pause, a PRIVMSG to the PAUSED channel still arrives. This is
//      vjt's ruling as an assertion — a paused window goes quiet, never blind
//      — and it is the one that fails if someone "simplifies" the pause into
//      an abandoned topic.
//
// And one more, on the outbound side: the join frame cic SENT for the paused
// channel must carry `{"presence":false}`. Without it the absence downstream
// would prove the server dropped frames nobody asked it to drop.
//
// THE CLOCK
//
// `PRESENCE_COOLDOWN_MS` is two minutes. Rather than burn that in wall-clock
// on every CI run, or add a production seam to shorten it, the spec drives
// Playwright's clock: install → resume (so boot and the network run at real
// speed) → `fastForward` past the window, which fires the pending cooldown
// timer and nothing else that matters. The cooldown's own arithmetic is
// covered by `presencePause.test.ts` under fake timers; what this spec is for
// is everything downstream of it.
