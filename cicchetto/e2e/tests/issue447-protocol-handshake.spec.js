// #447 — protocol version handshake + unauthenticated /api/config
// discovery, proven end-to-end THROUGH the nginx-test proxy (the same
// single-source `locations-api.conf` snippet prod uses), so the nginx
// allowlist trap is covered too: /api/config rides the existing `api`
// alt, and /socket rides its own block.
//
// The load-bearing distinction of #447 is that a too-old client gets a
// clean 426 Upgrade Required, NOT the opaque 403 an auth failure gets,
// NOT an accepted socket fed frames it will mangle. A browser `WebSocket`
// hides the handshake HTTP status, so we drive the upgrade URL with the
// APIRequestContext (`request.get`) instead: the endpoint's socket
// dispatch runs `UserSocket.connect/3` on any GET to /socket/websocket
// (the version check happens BEFORE the WS upgrade), so the raw HTTP
// status is readable — 426 for a below-floor client, 403 for a
// current-version-but-no-token client. The values are read from
// /api/config itself, never hardcoded, so the spec tracks the server
// constants.
import { expect, test } from "../fixtures/test";
// Phoenix's serializer negotiation runs BEFORE UserSocket.connect/3 and
// rejects a GET whose `vsn` matches no serializer — so the probe must
// carry a valid transport `vsn` (like phoenix.js appends) to reach the
// protocol-version gate at all. This is the phoenix transport protocol
// version, distinct from our app `client_proto` (that separation is the
// whole reason #447 did not overload `vsn`).
