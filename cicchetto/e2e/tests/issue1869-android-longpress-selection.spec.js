// #1869 — one long-press on a message row opened TWO menus on Android:
// Chrome's native selection toolbar over a native selection of the row, plus
// cic's own message menu.
//
// The selection/callout policy was gated on `html.is-ios`, which
// `lib/platform.ts` applies only when `isIos()`, so Android received none of
// it. But re-parenting the block is NOT the fix, and this spec exists because
// that distinction is invisible in the source: `-webkit-touch-callout` is
// WebKit-only. On iOS the policy is a PAIR — `callout: none` suppresses the
// platform's long-press UI, `user-select: text` keeps the row selectable for
// `Select…`. Blink has only the second half, and there `user-select: text` IS
// the native long-press selection.
//
// So on a coarse pointer the row is `none` STANDING and `text` under #1067's
// `is-selecting` latch. This runs on `chromium-pixel-touch` because that is the
// project whose engine (Blink) and pointer (coarse) both match the reported
// device — `webkit-iphone-15` cannot see this class of defect at all, since the
// property that masks it there does not exist here.
//
// ⚠️ WIRING + SERIALISATION ONLY — NOT PROOF THE TOOLBAR IS GONE. ⚠️
// Playwright renders no platform selection UI, so nothing here can assert that
// Chrome's toolbar does not appear; that half was verified by hand on an
// Android 17 emulator (Chrome 151) with an OS-level `adb input swipe`, and the
// screenshots are on the PR. What IS deterministic in CI is the cascade the
// engine is asked to apply, and the selection TEXT that cascade produces —
// which is the half that would silently rot. See docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md
// 2026-08-30 (#1869) and the sibling limitation notes in
// issue250-android-nick-select.spec.ts.
