// #1040 — on the HOME window the rail actions are expanded, in flow, with the
// buttons visible. Everywhere else #500's launcher stays the single door.
//
// The trap this spec is built around: "expanded" is trivially fakeable by
// leaving the overlay OPEN. That build would satisfy any assertion of the shape
// "the cog is visible on home" while shipping a popover pinned to the bottom
// edge of the rail, floating over an empty column, still capped by a max-height
// measured for a menu that opens upward. So the oracle here is CONTAINMENT, not
// visibility: `.rail-actions-menu` must lie inside the box of its
// `.rail-actions` container. That is true only in normal flow — the container
// wraps a static child and grows to it. With the menu still `position:
// absolute; bottom: 100%`, the container is a launcher-tall strip and the menu
// sits entirely ABOVE it, so its top is a few hundred px past the container's
// and this fails.
//
// The second test is the exception's fence: a channel window must still open
// the way #500 left it — launcher present, menu absent until tapped, and when
// tapped it floats ABOVE the launcher rather than in flow. Without it, "expand
// the rail" could quietly become "expand the rail everywhere", which is the
// regression #500 exists to prevent (a big channel's nick list back under the
// fold).
//
// Both form factors, because the issue asks for both and the mount sites
// differ: on desktop the rail is a permanent grid column, on mobile it is the
// slide-in drawer. The `@webkit` third test is the mobile arm (only tagged
// specs reach the iPhone project); the geometry oracle stays on the desktop one
// — inside a transformed, animating drawer a box comparison measures the slide
// as much as the layout.
//
// NOT claimed here: the felt result on a real phone. Playwright's webkit is not
// iOS Safari (no real momentum, no notch — `env()` resolves to 0), so whether
// the column reads well under a thumb, and whether a short device scrolls it
// comfortably, are vjt's device-verify calls.
