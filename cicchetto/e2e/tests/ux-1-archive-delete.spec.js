// UX-1 (2026-05-17) — Archive delete × + permanent scrollback drop.
//
// Validates the full UX-1 surface in a real browser:
//   1. PART a seeded channel → server emits :parted → channel drops out
//      of the active sidebar list.
//   2. Open the grouped ArchiveModal + expand the network's group →
//      the group lazy-loads → PARTed channel appears as an archive
//      entry with a × delete affordance.
//   3. Click × → InlineConfirmButton arms (label flips to "really
//      delete?").
//   4. Click again → DELETE /networks/:slug/archive/:target fires →
//      server drops the rows + broadcasts `archive_changed` → cic
//      re-fetches archive → the entry disappears.
//   5. Re-JOIN the channel and confirm the scrollback is EMPTY: this is
//      the smoking gun that the rows were actually deleted server-side
//      (vs the row merely vanishing from the cic-side cache).
//
// Per vjt scope decision: BOTH channel-kind AND query-kind get the
// delete affordance. Server-side dispatches by sigil. This spec covers
// the channel-kind path; the query-kind dispatch is covered by the
// controller test on the Elixir side (full cic-side dispatch parity
// is part of the broader cluster journey at UX-Z).
//
// Cleanup: re-JOIN the seeded channel in afterEach (mirror of CP15 B4
// pattern). The archive entry is gone for real — re-joining + sending
// a fresh message in this spec leaves a new row, which the next spec
// will inherit. That's fine; specs already cope with non-empty
// scrollback.
