// #1701 — chrome mounting UNDER a covering overlay must not leave a tail reader
// short of the tail once the overlay goes.
//
// The container twin of issue1121-overlay-close-tail-reader, which drives the
// same site on the CONTENT axis: there the box was steady and lines grew
// underneath, here the content is steady and the BOX shortens. Both are the one
// sentence `applyOverlayRestore` is now written around — the freeze holds a
// single number, and a scrollTop names a position only relative to the viewport
// it was read through.
//
// The gesture is the reported one, and every step of it is load-bearing:
//
//   * the rail's station picker holds a `createOverlayLock` refcount, so the
//     pane is FROZEN from the moment it opens;
//   * picking a station deliberately does NOT close it (`RailRadio`: a control
//     the operator re-flips in place is not a launcher), so the docked bar
//     mounts WHILE the freeze is up;
//   * the bar takes ~47px out of `.scrollback`, and #778's ResizeObserver
//     re-pin — which exists for exactly this class — is outranked by
//     overlay-freeze and dropped. Correctly: a mid-list reader under an overlay
//     must not be yanked;
//   * no overlay edge fires again until the picker is closed, and that close
//     edge is where the debt is owed.
//
// WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE IN RAW PIXELS AND NOT IN THE TAIL THRESHOLD.
// `SCROLL_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD_PX` is 50 and the bar is about 47, so "is the reader
// within the tail band" answers YES on the BROKEN build. A spec written against
// the threshold here would be green against the defect it is named after. The
// distance is therefore compared against the measured shrink and against a
// sub-pixel epsilon, and the shrink is measured rather than assumed so a bar
// that changes height does not quietly turn this vacuous.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK, the #682 posture: the stream and the logos are served
// from local bytes by `page.route`, scoped to the station's real URL so a change
// that stops requesting it still fails.
//
// Desktop project (untagged → chromium), like both siblings on this site. The
// freeze is not form-factor gated — `RailRadio` calls `createOverlayLock`
// unconditionally — so the defect reproduces identically here, and desktop
// Chrome is the platform whose scroll physics these specs are written against
// (feedback: webkit is not iOS). The mobile-only half of #1701, where the bar
// should be docked, is a separate layout ruling and is not this spec's subject.
