// #1063 acceptance 3 — the operator finds out what the Refresh they pressed did.
//
// The unit tests pin the DECISION (`bundleRefreshNotice.test.ts`) and the
// button-level wiring (`errorBanners.test.ts`). Neither can pin the CHAIN.
// jsdom has no service worker, no precache and no navigation, so there the
// reload is a function that was called, and "the marker survives the reload"
// is asserted by writing to `sessionStorage` and reading it back in the SAME
// document. This file is the only place that claim is actually tested: a real
// press, a real `performRefresh` (real SW update, real cache purge), a real
// navigation, and a real `Toasts` mount in the document that comes out the
// other side.
//
// THE PAIR IS THE POINT. Same gesture, same code; the only thing that differs
// is whether the bundle underneath moved:
//
//   * nothing moved → "Still on <label>"    ← #1063's complaint, and new
//   * bundle moved  → "Updated to <label>"  ← #775's toast, now also on the
//                                             MANUAL path (the behaviour
//                                             change #1063 accepted by ruling)
//
// Either test alone would still pass with a formatter that ignored the
// outcome and said one thing always. Together they cannot.
//
// Not duplicated from `issue1063-update-delivery.spec.ts`: that file is
// acceptance 5 (does a stale client reach the new bundle at all) and states
// what a real browser cannot witness. This one is about what the operator is
// TOLD, which is a different claim and reachable in full.
//
// TIMING, stated because it is the one coupling worth knowing about: a toast
// self-expires after `TOAST_MS` (6s), so the assertion has to be polling
// already when the reloaded document mounts. It is — there is no wait between
// the navigation and the `expect`, which starts before the SPA has even
// booted. Nothing here sleeps, and nothing here may be "fixed" by sleeping.
