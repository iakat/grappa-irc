// #1704 — Kohina ships knowing it will NOT play for some phones, and this spec
// is the reason that is allowed.
//
// THE SHIP ARGUMENT, and what it rests on. Every other row in the curated table
// is `audio/mpeg`; Kohina is Ogg Vorbis, measured off the stream's own bytes
// (`OggS` then `\x01vorbis`). Per the vendored caniuse-lite, iOS Safari decodes
// Ogg Vorbis from 18.4 (`y`), is partial from 17.4 to 18.3 (`a`, and the packed
// data carries no note text to say partial HOW), and does not decode it at all
// at 17.3 and below (`n`). So this row is silent for a population — and #1703's
// standing condition was that a station which cannot play must not ship while a
// stream that fails says nothing to anybody. #1744 built the saying-so; this
// spec is the proof that it fires, in a real browser, for THIS row.
//
// WHY A FAKE BODY AND NOT A REAL OGG. The point under test is the SURFACE, not
// anyone's codec support: `route.fulfill` serves bytes that are not decodable
// audio, so the element takes its resource-failure path and populates
// `MediaError` — which is the same door an unsupported codec walks through. A
// real Ogg body would instead measure whether THIS Playwright build decodes
// Vorbis, which is a fact about this Playwright build and not about iOS 17.3.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH, stated because a green here is easy to
// over-read. It does not establish that iOS below 18.4 fails on Kohina — that
// is caniuse's claim and it is not measurable from CI at any browser version we
// can drive. What it establishes is the conditional: GIVEN the element reports
// a media error, the operator is told, on the transport and on the rail, and
// the bar stops dressing the dead source as a zero-second file. The spec runs
// on both configured projects, so the WebKit half is measured on WebKit rather
// than inferred from Chromium.
