// #1094 — paging older history must not move the rows the operator is reading,
// even when they keep scrolling while the page is on the wire.
//
// The field report (vjt, 2026-08-23): *"salire e ripescare messaggi vecchi
// smuove tutto l'elenco e non è smooth per niente. arrivare in area di fetch
// in sostanza che causa il prelevamento dei vecchi messaggi sposta lo
// scrolltop e quindi sposta i messaggi visualizzati"*.
//
// WHY THIS SPEC EXISTS AND THE UNIT TESTS DO NOT COVER IT. The units
// (`scrollback.test.ts` #1094, `ScrollbackPane.test.tsx` #1094) pin the
// MECHANISM: which instant the geometry is read at, and that the correction
// lands in the same task as the mutation. They cannot pin the OUTCOME, because
// jsdom has no layout engine — every px in them is a `defineProperty`, so a
// change that kept the arithmetic and broke the rendered result would leave
// them green. What the operator reports is rendered geometry, and the only
// oracle for rendered geometry is a real browser.
//
// The oracle here is deliberately NOT frame sampling. A composited-frame probe
// is what measured the original defect (see the issue), but it needs a bespoke
// rAF harness and it answers a question that is inherently one frame wide. The
// durable statement is about an END STATE: pick a row the reader is looking at,
// note where it sits in the viewport, page older history in underneath it, and
// it must still be in the same place. That survives a retry, a slower CI box
// and a different page size.
//
// CP14 B2 already pins the same gesture, but from `scrollTop === 0`: it wheels
// all the way to the top in one throw, so the geometry at the moment the fetch
// is armed and the geometry at the moment it lands are the same numbers, and
// the defect is invisible. THE WHOLE POINT here is that they differ — the
// operator's flick carries on while the request is in flight, which is what an
// operator's flick does.
//
// #1151 (the frozen pane moving 11px for an 18px insertion) is ADJACENT and
// deliberately not folded in: the tolerance below is wide enough to survive
// that residue and narrow enough that the ~150px this issue is about cannot
// hide inside it.
//
// IT DISCRIMINATES, measured 2026-08-24. Reverting the cure to the pre-#1094
// shape — geometry captured before the `loadMoreScrollback` call instead of at
// its commit seam — fails this test on the anchor assertion at
// `Received: 150.5625` against a tolerance of 12, i.e. `ARM_AT_PX` to within
// half a pixel, exactly the error the restore makes and nothing else. With the
// cure in place the same run is green. A green here that has never been shown
// that red is not a guard, and this file spent three runs being red for a
// reason that had nothing to do with either (see the route hold below).
