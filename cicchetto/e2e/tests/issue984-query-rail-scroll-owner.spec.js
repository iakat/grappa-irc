// #984 — the QUERY branch of the rail had no scroll owner, so a tall WHOIS
// bundle pushed the `.rail-actions` launcher below the fold. vjt hit it on
// iPhone with the keyboard up (the drawer's height tracks `--viewport-height`,
// so the keyboard IS the fold), but the mechanism is form-factor-independent:
// `.shell-members` is `overflow-y: visible` by decision (#500 — the launcher's
// absolute overlay menu must not be clipped), which means an inner child has to
// own the scroll. `.members-pane` does; `.rail-query-context` was `flex: 0 0
// auto`, i.e. never shrink, no internal scroll.
//
// This is the exact twin of `issue500-rail-launcher-overflow`, one window kind
// over, and it is asserted the same way and for the same reason: boundingBox,
// never a plain click. Playwright auto-scrolls an element into its scroll
// container before clicking, so a click would MASK the defect. And never
// `getComputedStyle` for the reachability question — a computed-style
// assertion under device emulation has already lied once (#963). Geometry is
// the outcome the operator actually experiences.
//
// The second test covers the half no desktop assertion can see. The fix has a
// touch component: the mobile drawer sits under the `.shell-mobile {
// touch-action: none }` blanket (UX-3 PENT), so a NEW scroller must re-assert
// `pan-y` on itself AND on its subtree (touch-action does not inherit, CSS UI
// L4 — UX-6 bucket A v2). Without it the card scrolls under a mouse and
// refuses to scroll under a finger. There is no geometry for a gesture
// contract; the computed-style assertion on the webkit-iPhone project is the
// established shape for it (`ux-6-a-mobile-members-scroll.spec.ts`), and
// touch-action is not the paint-adjacent property #963 caught lying.
