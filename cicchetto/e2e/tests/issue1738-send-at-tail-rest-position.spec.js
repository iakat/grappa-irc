// Issue 1738 — after a send the scrollback comes to rest SHORT of its own
// tail: the sent line is flush against the chrome below it and the pane can
// still be hand-scrolled further down.
//
// ## What this spec is FOR, and it is not a cure
//
// It is the measurement issue 1738 was never given. The report is visual, from
// an iPhone, and its falsifiable content is one number — the residual
// `scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight` the pane rests at once a send has
// settled. "It can still be scrolled further by hand" IS that number being
// positive; nothing else in the report distinguishes the defect from a taste
// call about spacing.
//
// ## Why it is not `issue2031-send-with-marker-row-clipped.spec.ts`
//
// That spec measures the SAME write on the SAME platform and is the reason the
// mechanism is known. It differs in its precondition and in what it asserts:
//
//   * its send happens with the reader PARKED IN HISTORY and the unread marker
//     on screen — a scenario built to make the marker collapse a suspect. This
//     report has no marker and no parking: the reader is at the tail and sends.
//     The tail write is reached through `tailFollowWhenSettled` in both, but a
//     spec that only ever exercises the parked entry cannot say the plain one
//     rests correctly;
//   * it asserts the ROW's box against the PANE's box (`overflowBelowPx`) and
//     only LOGS `distanceFromBottomPx`. The row-clipping face and the
//     rest-position face are not the same claim: a row can sit entirely inside
//     the pane while the pane is still short of its tail by less than one row.
//     This report is about the pane's rest position, so that is the assertion.
//
// 🔴 That second bullet is MEASURED, not reasoned. On the mutant bench below —
// the pre-cure code, this gesture — the numbers separate exactly as the bullet
// predicts: `overflowBelow = -0.172` (webkit) / `-0.422` (chromium), i.e. the
// row sits FULLY INSIDE the pane and 2031's assertion is GREEN, while
// `distanceFromBottom` reads 7 and 6 and the pane really is short. So the 2031
// spec, re-run on the untouched tree, would have reported this report's gesture
// as fine. The distance assertion is the one that catches it, and that is the
// whole reason this file exists.
//
// ## What this measured  (2026-09-10, on e7677913b)
//
// CURED TREE, `--repeat-each 3`, and byte-identical across all three repeats of
// every case — 12/12 green:
//
//   webkit-iphone-15  #1738 iphone          distance 0   overflowBelow -6.813
//   webkit-iphone-15  #2031 iphone          distance 0   overflowBelow -7.438
//   chromium          #1738 desktop-player  distance 0   overflowBelow -6.422
//   chromium          #2031 desktop         distance 0   overflowBelow -6.641
//
// MUTANT BENCH, because a spec born green has not been shown to be able to
// fail. `scrollToTail`'s top-up (the two lines `fffcc344c` added) was removed,
// restoring the pre-cure shape, and all four entries went RED:
//
//   webkit-iphone-15  #1738 iphone          distance 7   overflowBelow -0.172
//   webkit-iphone-15  #2031 iphone          distance 7   overflowBelow +0.203
//   chromium          #1738 desktop-player  distance 6   overflowBelow -0.422
//   chromium          #2031 desktop         distance 7   overflowBelow +0.359
//
// The bench is verified to BE the pre-cure state rather than merely broken: the
// two 2031 rows reproduce the numbers its own header recorded over nine runs
// before any cure existed (+0.203 webkit, +0.359 chromium) to the third
// decimal. So a red here is the reported mechanism and not some other damage.
//
// ## The configuration the report was taken in
//
// vjt's screenshots have the docked radio player under the scrollback ("no
// breathing room between the last line and whatever chrome sits below — the
// docked player, or the compose box when no player is up"). `.audio-mini-player`
// is an in-flow flex sibling with no positioning trick, so it can only reach
// the tail write through `clientHeight`; the case is here because it is the
// REPORTED configuration, not because a mechanism is suspected in it.
//
// ## Platform split, and it is deliberate rather than uniform
//
// The no-player case runs on `webkit-iphone-15` — the platform the report came
// from, and the one where issue 2031 measured the pre-cure shortfall
// DETERMINISTICALLY (3/3, distanceFromBottom = 7).
//
// The player case runs on desktop chromium. Docking the bar is a rail gesture,
// and on mobile the rail lives inside the members drawer, whose overlay lock
// FREEZES the pane — so a mobile player case would have to open and close a
// drawer, and would be testing the drawer's freeze/restore (which is #1701's
// subject) rather than the rest position. Stated rather than quietly skipped:
// "iPhone WITH the player docked" is not covered by this file.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK (#682 posture): the stream is served from local bytes
// by `page.route`, scoped to the station's real URL so a change that stops
// requesting it still fails.
