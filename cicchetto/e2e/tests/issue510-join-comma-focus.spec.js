// #510 — `/join #a,#b` must focus the FIRST channel, never a phantom
// window literally named "#a,#b".
//
// The server handles the RFC1459 comma-list correctly (#382): it splits
// the list, canonical-folds + validates each element, and opens a
// `:pending → :joined` window PER channel. cic forwards the list unsplit
// (the POST body is the whole "#a,#b") — that part is right. The bug was
// purely client-side focus: compose.ts fed the RAW unsplit string to
// `setSelectedChannel`, so focus landed on a key ("#a,#b") that no
// `window_states` entry ever matches → an empty, topic-less phantom pane
// (header "#a,#b  (no topic set)", composer placeholder "message #a,#b").
//
// The fix splits on `,` and focuses the first element, canonicalised the
// SAME way the server folds window keys (`canonicalChannel`, the
// `Identifier.canonical_channel/1` twin). This spec proves the focus
// contract end-to-end: BOTH real rows join from one command, focus lands
// on #a, and the "#a,#b" phantom is never created.
//
// jsdom/vitest proves the compose.ts split+fold (compose.test.ts #510);
// this needs the live ircd multi-target JOIN round-trip + the real
// selection→ComposeBox render to prove the phantom is gone in a browser.
//
// vjt creates two fresh per-run channels via ONE `/join #x,#y` (→ sole op
// of each) and PARTs both in `finally`, keeping the shared testnet tidy.
