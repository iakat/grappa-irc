// #1061 acceptance 4 — "an e2e test that simulates `navigator.onLine === false`
// (and the `offline` event) and asserts we do absolutely nothing — no connect
// attempt, no scheduled retry — across the foreground/background transitions in
// (1). This is an explicit requirement, not a nice-to-have."
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY OBSERVED. Not a signal, not a counter cic maintains about
// itself: `page.on("websocket")` fires on every real WebSocket the browser
// opens. So "no connect attempt" is measured at the browser, one rung below
// anything the fix could accidentally satisfy by lying to itself. A retry
// LADDER, likewise, is not asserted by reading a timer — it is asserted by
// waiting out the window in which the ladder's own rungs would have fired
// (phoenix's default `reconnectAfterMs` is [10,50,100,150,200,250,500,1000,
// 2000] then 5s steady, so 2.5s of quiet is eight rungs that did not happen)
// and finding the count unmoved.
//
// ── WHY EVERY NEGATIVE HERE IS PAIRED, and why that is not decoration ──
//
// A spec that only asserts "nothing happened" passes just as happily when the
// gesture it made was inert — a stubbed event nobody listens to, a page that
// never finished booting. #1019 removed a backgrounding negative for exactly
// that reason: the premise could not be established, so the green meant
// nothing. Every negative below is therefore followed by the SAME gesture
// under the ONE changed condition (connectivity), which must produce a
// connection. If the stub were inert, the paired positive fails and the spec
// goes red — the assertions cannot both be satisfied by a dead harness.
//
// ── ON STUBBING `navigator.onLine` RATHER THAN GOING REALLY OFFLINE ──
//
// Test 2 uses Playwright's REAL `context.setOffline()`: genuinely no network, a
// genuine `offline` event, a genuinely false `navigator.onLine`.
//
// It cannot be used for test 1, because a cold start that BEGINS offline still
// has to load the app, and the service worker has no `fetch` handler to serve
// it from cache. A page that never loads tests nothing. So test 1 stubs the one
// input the guard reads. That stub is not a proxy for the behaviour under test
// — it IS the guard's input — and its liveness is proved by the paired positive
// rather than assumed.
//
// ── THE TWO TESTS USE DIFFERENT ORACLES, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT ──
//
// The first RED probe of this file (fix neutered, `scripts/integration.sh
// --grep "#1061"`) came back: test 1 FAILED on its first outcome assertion
// (`Expected: 0 / Received: 1`), test 2 **PASSED**. A real offline context does
// not surface cic's attempts to `page.on("websocket")` at all — Chromium
// refuses them below the level Playwright reports — so the browser-level oracle
// is BLIND in exactly the case test 2 exists to cover, and the test could not
// have failed however broken the code was.
//
// So test 2 now asserts on `connectAttempts` (see the helper), with the socket
// count kept as a secondary. Test 1 keeps the browser-level oracle, where it
// demonstrably works. Neither test was weakened to go green: test 2 was made
// able to go RED at all.
