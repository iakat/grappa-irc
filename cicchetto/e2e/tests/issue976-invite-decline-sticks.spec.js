// #976 — the invite banner's × is a DECLINE, and a declined invite STAYS
// declined. This file was `issue902-invite-banner-dismiss-ephemeral.spec.ts`
// and asserted the exact opposite; before that it was
// `issue511-invited-dismiss-durable.spec.ts` and asserted this. The renames
// are the honest record of a contract that has been deliberately reversed
// twice, not of tests being tidied.
//
// #511's subject was the greyed `:invited` pseudo-row, whose dismissal had to
// be durable: a client-only drop let #482's cold-subscribe backfill re-emit
// `window_invited` and the dismissed TAB came back. #902 replaced the row with
// a banner and ruled its × session-scoped — "an invite is allowed to be lost",
// the peer can invite again — so the return was reclassified from bug to
// intent.
//
// #976 reverses that, because the escape hatch it rested on did not exist. A
// channel left `:invited` only by being JOINed: no verb dropped the state,
// nothing expired it, so the invite was re-asserted at the top of the page on
// every reload until the operator gave in. The reporter's words: "una volta
// chiuso con la x non dovresti più riproporlo ... sennò è cazzo stalking". An
// offer you cannot refuse is not an offer.
//
// So what this guards is the REVERSAL, and each half earns its assertion:
//
//   * the DECLINED invite does not return after a reload — the difference
//     between a decline and #902's hide, invisible to any unit test because
//     the client-local behaviour is identical either way and only the SERVER
//     key differs;
//   * the KEPT invite does return — the decline must not have been a blanket
//     clear, and (see below) it doubles as the barrier;
//   * a SECOND DEVICE loses the declined banner without touching it. The
//     `:invited` state is per-session and reaches clients by broadcast, so a
//     decline that did not fan out would leave device B showing an invite the
//     server no longer holds, and re-showing it on B's next reload — the
//     original complaint with one extra step.
//
// TWO invites, only ONE declined — the KEPT one is the condition-based
// co-witness inherited from #511. Both `window_invited` events ride the SAME
// ordered user-topic cold-snapshot burst (`push_session_snapshot` →
// `WindowState.invited_windows/2`), a DIFFERENT cold-load cycle from the REST
// `/channels` chain that repaints the autojoin tab. Waiting for the KEPT
// banner proves that burst was dispatched + processed, so the verdict on the
// DECLINED one is read at a proven-settled moment rather than raced against a
// slower snapshot. Without it, "it did not come back" would be a statement
// about timing, not about the server key.
//
// Needs the live upstream + a session surviving a browser reload, which
// jsdom/vitest cannot do (per feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke).
