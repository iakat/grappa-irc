// #445 — where focus lands when a greyed pseudo-row is dismissed with ×.
//
// #71 INC-3 unified the pseudo-row × behind one verb (`dismissPseudoWindow`)
// and, to keep the desktop behaviour byte-identical, kept the Sidebar's
// explicit redirect to the network `$server` window. It recorded the target
// itself as an open product question, because every OTHER window close in
// the app — /part, a server-side kick, the /disconnect cascade, a query
// close — lands on the most-recently-viewed window via selection.ts's
// bucket-E close-watcher. vjt ruled MRU (issue #445, 2026-08-07).
//
// MRU is not a different redirect, it is one fewer: the verb stops
// pre-empting the watcher that already owns every other close target.
//
// WHY AN E2E, AND WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: the landing is a
// COMPOSITION of three parties that no unit can hold at once — the ×
// dropping the windowState key, the server's PART cleanup, and the
// watcher's live-window scan across channelsBySlug + queryWindowsByNetwork
// + windowStateByChannel. jsdom sees the first and the third with the
// second mocked. #902 deleted `issue71-inc3-bottombar-invite.spec.ts`, the
// only e2e that had ever pinned a pseudo-row dismiss LANDING, and recorded
// the deletion as a real coverage loss in its commit message; this file
// takes that coverage back at the `:failed` shape, which — unlike the
// `:invited` one #902 retired — still exists.
//
// The pre-state assertion is load-bearing: `/join` focuses the channel it
// joins (compose.ts), so the rejected join leaves the greyed row FOCUSED.
// Without asserting that first, "focus is on the seed channel afterwards"
// is equally true of a run where focus never left the seed channel.
//
// Scope: desktop chromium. The rule is surface-independent by
// construction — one verb, and since #902 the mobile BottomBar renders no
// pseudo-rows at all, so there is no second surface left to diverge.
//
// CHANNEL CLEANUP: random per-run suffixes; afterEach has the peer quit.
