// M-cluster M-9b — admin Sessions tab end-to-end: list + per-row
// Disconnect + Terminate actions + 422 self-protection.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: admin-gated EXEMPT —
// only the admin user class reaches the tab; the gate spec lives at
// m7-admin-gate-settings-drawer.spec.ts.
//
// Per `feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke`: this Playwright spec IS
// the browser smoke for M-9b — chromium in the e2e harness renders
// the two-button-per-row inline-confirm CSS class flips that vitest
// jsdom can't see.
//
// Pre-seed pattern (per `feedback_visitor_mint_e2e_cold_start`):
// the m9b-test user + bind is in the seeder sidecar (compose.yaml),
// NOT minted at test time. Bootstrap spawns its Session.Server at
// grappa-test boot so the row is visible in /admin/sessions by the
// time the spec runs.
//
// Self-disconnect protection: admin-vjt has NO network bind in the
// seeder, so it has NO row in /admin/sessions. The 422
// `cannot_disconnect_self` server gate is therefore unreachable from
// this spec — every visible row belongs to vjt or m9b-test, both
// non-admin. The unit-level coverage for the 422 surface lives in
// AdminSessionsTab.test.tsx ("surfaces a 422 cannot_disconnect_self
// error inline prefixed with the verb"). Adding a Playwright case
// would require seeding admin-vjt with a network bind, which would
// in turn double the admin-vjt session footprint and complicate
// every other admin spec — out of scope here.
