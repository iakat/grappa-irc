// #1765 — `»N` on the only unread window, when that window is far behind.
//
// Two cures that are each right cancel out. #1178 made the jump verb
// short-circuit to `requestScrollToBottom()` when the cycle resolves back to
// the window the operator is already in; #693/#1019 freeze the read cursor
// while a window is far behind, deliberately, so that scroll cannot advance
// it. With both in force the tap moved nothing at all: the bar stayed, the
// frozen seed stayed, and the button kept advertising a count.
//
// The cure routes that arm to the bar's PRIMARY exit — the jump BACK into the
// unread region — and not to its `×`. What that difference LOOKS like is
// exactly what this spec measures, because the two are indistinguishable from
// "the bar went away":
//
//   * the bar goes away AND the pane lands on the unread divider, carrying the
//     server-measured count. A dismiss also clears the bar, and re-latches the
//     divider away, so the marker is the discriminator between the two;
//   * the SERVER cursor has NOT crossed the abandoned region. This is the
//     product claim, not a mechanism: a tap on an unlabelled `»` that reads
//     `1` (it counts WINDOWS) must not accept thousands of messages as read on
//     every device. #1062 already removed a second dismiss surface from the
//     float stack this button lives in, for the neighbouring reason.
//
// NOT asserted: that the button hides. It should not, and that is the honest
// outcome rather than a gap — after the jump the unread is local, real, and on
// screen, so the count it renders is true for the first time. Reading to the
// tail clears it, or a second tap now takes #1178's exit with the freeze gone.
// The issue's Expected clause asked for the button to hide; that followed from
// its dismiss proposal, which the fix declines.
//
// Seeding mirrors `issue1062-far-behind-float-stack.spec.ts` and
// `issue1019-farbehind-leave-dismiss.spec.ts` (same bar, same precondition):
// the shared seeder plants 200 rows in #spec-wN and this needs a gap ABOVE the
// 200-row page cap, so it re-seeds via the admin `resetSubject(baselineSeed)`
// surface. Nothing has to be undone afterwards: #1078 destroys the whole
// subject at teardown, rows and cursor with it. Seeding ONE channel is also
// what makes it the ONLY unread window, which is the state the bug needs.
//
// No sleep is used as synchronisation: every step waits on an observable
// condition. The timeouts are WAIT BUDGETS on those conditions, never the
// thing being measured.
//
// Desktop viewport, as both sibling far-behind specs: the sidebar badge is the
// clearer read of "the count is no longer the frozen one".
