// #1019 — leaving a far-behind window IS the bar's ×.
//
// vjt, on IRC: *"il focus out su una finestra con molto scrollback e con la
// top bar dovrebbe fare mark as read, come se avessimo premuto la X"*. The
// far-behind bar (#693/#888) had two exits and both cost a deliberate click;
// an operator who simply moves on to another window used to carry a frozen
// badge that no amount of reading could clear, because #693 freezes the read
// cursor on purpose and the leave writer is one of the four the freeze holds
// back.
//
// The fix ROUTES the leave writer to `dismissFarBehind` instead of thawing
// `setCursorIfAdvances` for it. That distinction is invisible from the
// outside, so what this spec pins is the OUTCOME, three ways:
//
//   * the sidebar badge falls once the operator selects another window —
//     the thing they could not achieve without finding the × at the top edge;
//   * the SERVER-side cursor lands at (or past) the tail — the same
//     `setReadCursor` fan-out the × performs, which is what "identical in
//     effect to clicking ×" in the Acceptance clause actually means. A purely
//     local badge clear would satisfy the first assertion and leave every
//     other device still far behind;
//   * coming BACK shows no bar and no phantom count — the second Acceptance
//     clause, and the one that would catch a dismiss that cleared the badge
//     without moving the cursor the resume re-reads.
//
// Measured RED on the parent commit (`dbdefa6b`, the fix absent): the run
// reached assertion 1 and stopped there —
//   `expect(locator).toHaveCount(expected) failed / Expected: 0 / Received: 1`
//   `14 × locator resolved to 1 element - unexpected value "1"`
// i.e. every precondition held (bar attached, badge far-behind, cursor still
// where it was planted) and only the outcome was missing. The failure lands on
// the outcome, not on a locator and not in setup, which is what makes this a
// guard rather than a mirror.
//
// ── What this file does NOT cover, and why it is absent rather than faked ──
//
// Q1 was ruled by vjt on the issue: only (a), a window switch INSIDE cic,
// dismisses; (b) tab backgrounding and (c) OS window blur must NOT. Those two
// negatives are NOT asserted here. A test that drove them via a second tab and
// `page.bringToFront()` was written, run, and REMOVED after measurement: on
// both the local host and the CI runner the polled precondition
// `document.visibilityState === "visible" && document.hasFocus()` stayed
// **true** for the full 10s budget on the supposedly backgrounded page. Both
// conjuncts true means neither the visibility edge nor the focus edge ever
// fired, so `documentVisibility.ts`'s `computeVisible()` never changed value
// and the `on(isDocumentVisible)` arm in `ScrollbackPane` was never asked the
// question. The spec proved nothing about the product — it could not even
// establish its own premise — and a negative that cannot fail is worse than an
// absent one.
//
// The honest place for those two negatives is the vitest guardrail in
// `ScrollbackPane.test.tsx`, which drives the visibility-hide writer directly
// and was mutation-measured (routing `settleCursorToVisibleTail` to the
// dismiss turns it red). Synthesising a `visibilitychange` from
// `page.evaluate` would have produced a green here, but it would mean
// asserting against a stubbed browser API inside a real browser — the one
// place a stub buys nothing.
//
// Also NOT covered, for a product reason rather than a harness one:
// `channel → home / mentions / admin` unmounts the pane and lands in
// `onCleanup`, where `props` already read the ARRIVING virtual selection, so
// the leaving window cannot be named. That switch leaves the far-behind state
// STANDING (the safe side — the region stays recoverable) and the PR says so
// at the call site. This spec therefore leaves for the SERVER window, which
// shares the `kindHasScrollback` Match with channels and so keeps the pane
// mounted and fires the key arm — the same gesture
// `cursor-forward-only.spec.ts` uses to drive the leave writer, and one that
// introduces no new name into the shared testnet namespace.
//
// ── Mechanics ──
//
// Seeding mirrors `issue1062-far-behind-float-stack.spec.ts` (same bar, same
// precondition): the shared seeder plants 200 rows in #bofh and this needs a
// gap ABOVE the 200-row page cap, so it re-seeds via the admin
// `resetSubject(baselineSeed)` surface. Nothing has to be undone afterwards:
// #1078 destroys the whole subject at teardown, rows and cursor with it.
//
// No sleep is used as synchronisation: every step waits on an observable
// condition (the bar attaching, the badge reaching count 0, the server cursor
// reaching the tail). The cursor is written server-side at SETTLE cadence, so
// the timeouts here are WAIT BUDGETS on those conditions, never the thing
// being measured.
//
// Desktop viewport on purpose, matching #997: the sidebar badge is the clearer
// read of "the badge fell" than the mobile tab treatment.
