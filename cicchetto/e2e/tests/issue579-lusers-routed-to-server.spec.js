// #579 — `/lusers <mask> <server>` must actually route the query to the
// named server.
//
// Bug: cic's parser was `lusers: (_verb, _rest) => ({ kind: "lusers" })`, so
// both RFC 2812 §3.4.2 arguments were discarded and every /lusers reached the
// wire as a bare LUSERS. The operator who named a server read the LOCAL
// server's counts believing they had queried the one they typed — a wrong
// answer with no error.
//
// Why this spec drives the TWO-token form and not `/lusers <mask>`:
// bahamut's `send_lusers` never `match()`es the mask (azzurra/bahamut
// src/s_serv.c:2100-2315 — `parv[1]` is never dereferenced and there is no
// `match()` in the function), so a mask ALONE has no observable effect on
// this ircd; a spec built on it would be green whether or not the fix is
// present. Routing is the observable half: `m_lusers` calls `hunt_server`
// only when BOTH tokens are present (src/s_serv.c:2085), and the server that
// answers reports ITS OWN figures via RPL_LUSERME (`m_client` / `m_server`)
// — the card's "this server" field.
//
// The assertion is a DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO ROUTED REPLIES, not a comparison
// against the local one. The testnet is a real mesh (hub + leaf-v4 + leaf-v6
// + services) and the bouncer's session lands on a leaf via the
// `bahamut-test` alias — but which leaf is not pinned anywhere the client can
// see, and an older spec (issue540) still describes the session as dialling
// the hub. Comparing hub-vs-leaf4 sidesteps that entirely: whichever of them
// happens to be the session's own server, the two are DIFFERENT servers, so
// their per-server counts must differ (a hub carries the leaves' links and no
// clients; a leaf carries clients and one link). Pre-#579 both commands
// reached the wire as the same bare LUSERS, so both replies came from the
// session's own server and the two snapshots were identical — this spec fails
// on that code.
//
// Per feedback_ux_e2e_mandatory: every cic UX-behavior change ships with a
// Playwright e2e via scripts/integration.sh.

// `leaf[46].azzurra.chat` in its NOTICEs). The mask is `*` — bahamut ignores
// it, and `hunt_server` reads the target from the SECOND slot, so the mask is
// only there to make the two-token frame well-formed (a server with no mask
