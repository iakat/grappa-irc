// #1807 — the credits rain is loud, the Debug panel's rain is NOT, and the
// interlude burst rides the roll's own clock.
//
// WHAT ONLY THIS GATE CAN SEE. #1807 made `MatrixRain`'s four drawing knobs
// per-surface. vitest can pin the numbers each caller passes and the ops the
// component issues against a recording context, and it does
// (`AdminDebugTab.test.tsx`, `MatrixRain.test.tsx`). What it cannot do is
// rasterise: jsdom has no canvas, so "the credits rain actually puts a
// near-opaque pixel on screen and the phosphor panel actually does not" is
// unreachable there. Reading the pixels back with `getImageData` is that
// claim, made against a real 2D rasteriser.
//
// It also cannot run a CSS animation. `creditsRain.rollIsParked` reads the
// roll's phase and takes the start of the interlude off the animation's OWN
// keyframes, so the stylesheet stays the single source of truth — and every
// jsdom test of it runs against a HAND-BUILT `getAnimations`. That the
// browser exposes `computedOffset` and the parked transform the reader
// depends on is asserted here, on the real animation, and so is the
// consequence: seeking the ROLL's clock into the hold makes the RAIN change.
// That is the one-clock contract, and a rain driven by a `setTimeout` of its
// own would sail straight through it.
//
// THE METRIC. Premultiplied channel value, `channel * alpha`. The canvas
// accumulates a black wash, so the raw (unpremultiplied) value a pixel
// reports depends on how opaque its backing has become; the premultiplied
// one does not, and it is what the compositor puts on screen.
//
//   * one Debug glyph is `rgba(255, 176, 0, 0.18)` -> premultiplied red 46
//   * the credits leader is `rgba(255, 232, 176, 0.95)` -> red 242, blue 167
//   * the BURST leader is white at full alpha -> red 255, blue 255
//
// So red separates "there is a bright head" from "there is only dim trail",
// and blue separates the white burst leader from the amber steady one. The
// thresholds below sit in the wide middle of each gap.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PROVEN HERE, and cannot be: whether it READS as rain. That is
// a judgement about legibility over a dark theme on a real device, and the
// issue asks for it on a real iPhone, on BOTH surfaces. See the dogfood
// checklist on the PR.
//
// SCOPE. chromium only. The defect's platform is a phone, and this is not
// it — but the two claims made here are engine-independent (canvas 2D
// rasterisation and the Web Animations API), and the mobile project only
// takes `@webkit`-tagged specs.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: the Debug panel is
// admin-gated, the EXEMPT shape; the credits roll is subject-shape-agnostic
// (it names the BUILD, not the reader), so registered vjt suffices — the
// same reading #1773's spec made.
