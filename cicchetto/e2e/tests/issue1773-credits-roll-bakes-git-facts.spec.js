// #1773 — the credit roll paints the git facts the WRAPPER derived, not a
// plausible shape.
//
// THIS IS THE ONLY GATE THAT CAN SEE THE BAKE. The three facts (commit sha,
// its date, the contributor counts) are derived outside the build container by
// `infra/packaging/credits.sh` and carried in as vite's
// `__GRAPPA_CREDITS_JSON__` define. `vitest.config.ts` is a SEPARATE config
// with no `define`, so every unit test in the repo — buildCredits.test.ts
// included — exercises the DEGRADED path by construction. If the define, the
// env plumbing or the wrapper broke, the whole unit suite would stay green and
// the modal would roll an empty list in production.
//
// So the oracle here is not a shape. `scripts/integration.sh` derives the
// payload and exports it; `e2e/compose.yaml` hands the SAME string to
// `cicchetto-build-test` (which bakes it) and to `playwright-runner` (which is
// this process). Comparing what the modal PAINTS against `GRAPPA_CREDITS`
// compares the two ends of the channel. A shape assertion — "there is a sha",
// "the list is an array" — cannot tell a correct roll from an EMPTY one, and
// an empty roll is the exact defect the channel exists to prevent.
//
// The payload is read with a bare `JSON.parse`, NOT with `coerceBuildCredits`:
// `e2e/` is its own package and allows only TYPE imports from `src/` (see
// `fixtures/grappaApi.ts`, and `src/__tests__/e2eConstantMirrors.test.ts` for
// the discipline). That is a feature of the oracle rather than a compromise —
// parsing the payload independently is what lets this spec disagree with the
// production coercer instead of inheriting its bugs.
//
// SCOPE. chromium only, and deliberately: the defect's platform is the BUILD
// CHANNEL, which is engine-independent. What is NOT proven here is anything
// about the surface on a device — the notch clearance is source-level asserted
// in `src/__tests__/safeAreaInsetToken.test.ts`, the reduced-motion arm is a
// media query no engine here has the preference set for, and the soundtrack is
// not observable from Playwright at all.
//
// Parity matrix: the roll is subject-shape-agnostic (it names the BUILD, not
// the reader) — registered vjt suffices.

/**
 * The payload the wrapper derived, or a thrown explanation.
 *
 * Both refusals below are ANTI-HOLLOW-GREEN guards, and each names a different
 * broken thing:
 *
 *  - UNSET means the compose plumbing did not reach this container. Defaulting
 *    to `{}` here would turn the spec into a shape check silently, which is the
 *    failure mode the whole file exists to avoid.
 *  - DEGRADED (`sha: null`) is a legitimate payload in production — the AUR
 *    tarball builds with no `.git`, and so does a plain `docker build` of
 *    Dockerfile.release (the PUBLISHED image no longer degrades: release.yml
 *    passes the payload in as a build arg, #1834) — but it is NOT
 *    legitimate HERE: `scripts/integration.sh` runs inside the repository, so a
 *    null sha means the deriver failed rather than that the build has no
 *    history. Accepting it would let this spec pass against a wrapper that
 *    silently stopped deriving anything.
