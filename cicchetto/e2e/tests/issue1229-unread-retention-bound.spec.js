// #1229 — the unread exemption has a ceiling now, and crossing it is visible.
//
// S20's ring cap never evicts a row at/after the read cursor. That exemption
// had no ceiling, so a channel the operator does not read holds ALL of its
// unread rows and the cap does nothing. Since the pane renders every retained
// row (measured on origin/main: 1084 retained rows produce 1084
// `.scrollback-line` nodes, ratio 1.0000, no windowing anywhere in the render
// path), retention and rendered DOM are the same curve — ~19-26 KB of renderer
// memory per row, ~26 MB for the reporter's window, against a ceiling iOS
// applies per web process.
//
// The bound is one page of unread (`UNREAD_RETENTION_CAP = PAGE_LIMIT`), and
// past it the window joins the far-behind state the client already has for
// exactly this shape: divider suppressed, "N unread — jump back" banner,
// `jumpToUnread` rebuilding the region from the server.
//
// ── #1538 REVERSED points 3 and 4 of this spec. Read this before the list ──
//
// This spec used to pin the opposite of what it pins now, and the history
// matters because the reversal is a ruling, not a refactor.
//
// Points 3 and 4 below USED TO read: "the OLDEST unread row is gone from the
// DOM, and the rows the operator is looking at are NOT", and "`scrollTop` is
// preserved across the bite" — with the note that this "distinguishes the
// implementation that shipped from the simpler one that did not: dropping
// 'everything but the newest page' would have satisfied (2) while deleting
// the screen out from under a reader scrolled up in history."
//
// What that traded away is what #1538 came back as. Keeping the read context
// while excising the oldest unread means lifting a block out of the INTERIOR
// of the loaded range, and the read cursor was standing in for "where the
// operator is looking". For the reader who has scrolled DOWN past the divider
// — into the unread region — the rows "just under the divider" are the rows on
// screen, and the excision cut them out from under them. Two reporters,
// #sniffo, nine rows out of the middle of a rendered range, unrepairable by
// scrolling up (`loadMore` pages before `rows[0]`, which sits ABOVE the hole).
//
// vjt's ruling on #1538, and it is the acceptance criterion this spec now
// verifies rather than a preference it accommodates:
//
//     "basta che lo scroll sia contiguo e non ci siano buchi"
//
// So the bound now collapses to a contiguous tail window, the read context
// goes with the prefix, and the viewport DOES move — an announced loss, on a
// pane that is simultaneously raising "N unread — jump back". The assertions
// below are that criterion, checked from outside.
//
// ── What this spec pins, and why each assertion is here ──────────────────
//
// The gesture is ONE live PRIVMSG, not a flood. The cursor is planted so the
// window sits at exactly one page of unread — the widest window every path
// still calls near — so a single arriving row is the whole crossing; a burst
// would prove the same thing while also inviting the ircd's flood kill into
// the spec.
//
//   1. Before the gesture: no bar, and the in-pane divider is there. Without
//      this the outcome could be a bar that was already up for another reason
//      (a cold far-behind resume, #693) and the spec would test nothing.
//   2. After it: the bar is up with the honest total, and the divider is gone.
//      That is the state transition, seen from outside.
//   3. THE RULING: what remains in the DOM is a CONTIGUOUS run of the
//      channel's rows as the server orders them — no hole, at any width.
//      Checked against `fetchAllMessagesAsc` rather than by id arithmetic,
//      and that is load-bearing: `messages.id` is a GLOBAL autoincrement, so
//      consecutive rows of one channel carry non-consecutive ids and an
//      id-gap scan cannot tell a punched hole from ordinary numbering. The
//      server's own ordering is the only thing that can. The assertion is
//      only meaningful because the list is not virtualised — every retained
//      row is in the DOM whatever the scroll position, which is the same
//      measurement that motivated #1229 in the first place.
//   4. The oldest unread row AND the read-context row are both gone: the drop
//      is a PREFIX. Pinning both ends is what separates the collapse from an
//      excision that merely happened to take the row this spec sampled.
//
// Scrolling up is also what keeps the precondition alive: `setCursorIfAdvances`
// is forward-only, so with the pane scrolled into the read context the settle
// writer can only propose an id BELOW the planted cursor, and is refused. A
// pane left at the tail would advance the cursor to the newest row, unread
// would fall to zero, and the ceiling would never be approached.
//
// ── Why the peer joins during SETUP, and not as part of the gesture ──────
//
// A peer's JOIN is a scrollback row like any other. Server side, an
// other-user JOIN emits `:persist :join` (`lib/grappa/session/event_router.ex`,
// pinned by `test/grappa/session/event_router_test.exs:1727` — "JOIN-other
// adds nick to state.members[channel] + emits :persist :join"). Client side
// nothing filters it back out: `subscribe.ts`'s `routeMessage` appends every
// message with no kind gate, and `capScrollbackRing`'s `unreadHeld` counts
// rows by id with no kind gate either.
//
// So a JOIN issued AFTER the cursor is planted lands above it, and the
// "one row" crossing is really TWO: the JOIN takes the protected region past
// the ceiling and the bound bites once (banner at `unreadHeld`), then the
// PRIVMSG bites it again — and `scrollback.ts`'s accumulation on the second
// bite (`current.missed + unreadDropped`, deliberate: after the first bite the
// store only ever holds one page, so a recount would report the bound forever
// while the operator is thousands behind) reports `UNREAD_BOUND + 1` RAW ROWS.
//
// #2037 A changed what the banner DISPLAYS of that: the number is the MESSAGES
// bucket now, so the JOINs past the cursor come out of it and this fixture
// reads 199 rather than 201. The ARMING is untouched and still raw — what arms
// far-behind is "a row at/after the cursor left the store", which a JOIN does
// as surely as a message. Only the displayed quantity narrowed, and the
// assertion below derives the expected value rather than carrying a second
// magic number.
//
// That number is an artefact of the setup, not the behaviour under test. The
// peer therefore joins BEFORE anything is measured, so its row is part of the
// read history the cursor is planted into, and the gesture is the single
// PRIVMSG this spec says it is.
//
// ── NOT covered here, deliberately ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The far-behind banner's own behaviour (jump, dismiss, badge) belongs to
// #693/#888/#1019 and is pinned there; this spec asserts only that the bound
// DELIVERS the window into that state. The memory figures above are not
// asserted by any e2e — they were measured with a browser and a heap probe,
// and a spec that re-measured them would be pinning the host, not the product.
//
// This spec does NOT claim anything about the half-height frame #1229 was
// filed for: that reproduces with the admin pane focused and zero scrollback
// rows mounted, so no scrollback bound can explain it.
