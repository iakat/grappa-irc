// #666 — a multi-line paste that outruns the server's send-door throttle must
// NOT lose the lines past the 429, and must NOT leave the whole body in the
// composer (which duplicates the delivered lines on resend). The fix makes the
// fan-out (compose.ts sendBodyLines) resumable + self-pacing: a send-door 429
// PAUSES on the server's `retry-after` and retries the SAME (refused, never-
// delivered) line, draining the whole paste over time; the draft holds ONLY the
// unsent remainder throughout and empties once every line is out. No line is
// dropped; the refused line is delivered exactly once (no dup).
//
// The dev/e2e stack runs the send throttle effectively OFF (config/dev.exs:
// capacity 1000, refill 1000/s) so a plain paste can't trip it here — so this
// spec SIMULATES the throttle at the network edge: one middle line is refused
// ONCE with a real 429 + `retry-after` header (exactly what
// messages_controller/#666 now emits), then admitted on retry; every other POST
// passes to the LIVE server so its WS echo renders the row. That drives the
// CLIENT's resumable/paced path against a real 429 frame end to end — the flow
// jsdom can't observe (no live WS echo, no real retry-after round-trip). The
// unit matrix (compose.test.ts) pins the residue mechanics; this pins the live
// wire outcome (per feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke).
//
// Safe on the shared vjt: the send-door 429 does NOT feed the coarse #630 sever
// ladder (only RequestBudget.check does), and 9 POSTs are nowhere near the dev
// coarse capacity (200), so nothing severs vjt's bearer.
