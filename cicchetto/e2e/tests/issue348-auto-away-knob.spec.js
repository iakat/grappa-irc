// #348 — the auto-away debounce is a per-user knob, and turning it has
// to change what other people see.
//
// Until this, the grace period between "every device of mine is hidden"
// and the upstream `AWAY` was one compile-time constant for the whole
// deployment. The ask was a per-user setting with an off state, and the
// two claims worth an e2e are the ones no unit test can make:
//
//   1. the bouncer waits the value the user PICKED IN THE UI, not the
//      deployment's own default;
//   2. changing it reaches a session that is already running — no
//      reconnect, no restart.
//
// Both are asserted the way a human would notice them: through a peer's
// WHOIS, which shows `301 RPL_AWAY` exactly when the network thinks the
// user is away. The knob is driven through the settings control, not
// through the REST endpoint — the control is half of what #348 shipped.
//
// Three of the four assertions here are NEGATIVE ("not away yet", "away
// cleared", "off means never"), and a negative read off a line stream is
// worthless: no-301-heard is also what a dead peer, a throttled reply and
// a nick that never registered all look like. So every question is a
// complete WHOIS round-trip ending in `318 RPL_ENDOFWHOIS`
// (`IrcPeer.whoisAway`) — the peer asked, the network answered, and the
// answer did or did not carry a 301. Silence is an error, never a verdict.
//
// The integration env sets the deployment default SHORT
// (`config/dev.exs`, `auto_away_debounce_ms: 2_000`) so the #671 spec
// need not wait ten minutes. That number is what makes this spec's
// oracle sharp: a CUSTOM value well above it can be told apart from the
// default, because an answered "still present" long after 2s can only
// mean the preference is in force.
//
// Per `feedback_ux_e2e_mandatory`: server behaviour a client observes,
// so it ships with a Playwright e2e via scripts/integration.sh.

// that nothing was heard. That distinction is what makes the three
// negative assertions below worth anything: watching the line stream for
// a 301 reports the same silence whether auto-away correctly held off,
// or the peer died, or bahamut throttled the reply. Three of this spec's
// four assertions want `false`, so silence must never be able to produce
// it — a peer that stops answering now throws.
//
// The final probe is taken AT the end of the window, so a `false` verdict
// speaks about the window's closing instant and not some earlier moment
// inside it.
