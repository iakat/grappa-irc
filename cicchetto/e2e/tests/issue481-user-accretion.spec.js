// #481 — a USER (not a visitor) self-connects an available network from the
// home page. The visitor-only premise on the "available to connect" tier was
// a #461 relic; three gates enforced it (empty server payload for users, a
// 403 write verb, and the client section). This spec proves the FEATURE
// end-to-end in the browser: a user one-taps an available `visitor_enabled`
// network and it connects LIVE.
//
// The dedicated `accr481` user (NO network bind — seeded in compose.yaml)
// logs in via the loginAs seam, so home renders the self-serve state. It
// one-taps azzurra2, which points at SOLANUM (bahamut-test2) — an
// INDEPENDENT nick namespace, so the shared-leaf 433 trap
// (feedback_e2e_multinet_live_needs_distinct_nicks) never fires on the fresh
// dial. The visible outcome: azzurra2's network section appears LIVE in the
// sidebar. It started AVAILABLE (not attached), so its appearance = the
// accretion bound a USER credential + spawned + connected it.
//
// Server-side correctness (visitor_enabled bound holds for users, a USER
// credential is bound, the spawn rides the user connect capacity path) is
// pinned RED-first in test/grappa_web/controllers/session_controller_test.exs
// + test/grappa/networks_test.exs; this is the real browser end-to-end.
//
// Cleanup — the one-tap leaves a LIVE accr481@azzurra2 Session.Server. That
// pid surfaces in GET /admin/sessions (registry-driven: one row = one live
// pid — see GrappaWeb.Admin.SessionsController), which m9b's exact-count
// canary reads (`toHaveCount(4)`, "a rise means a leaked session"). On the
// 1-worker suite this file (i…) runs before m9b (m…), so a leaked session
// inflates m9b's count and 15s-times-out its assertion. The subject-kind-
// separate cap pool (U-1 split) bounds CAPACITY blast radius, NOT the shared
// admin-sessions list — the original "zero blast radius, no cleanup needed"
// reasoning weighed only the caps and missed the registry canary. So afterAll
// PARKS accr481's azzurra2 session via its OWN user park verb (PATCH
// /networks/:slug connection_state:"parked" → stops the pid → the row drops),
// restoring the 4-row baseline. `accr481` is used by no other spec, so the
// park has no cross-spec effect; the :parked credential it leaves lands only
// on /admin/credentials (a<i: those specs run before this one).
