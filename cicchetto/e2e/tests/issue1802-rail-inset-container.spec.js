// #1802 — the rail's horizontal inset, measured on every surface at once.
//
// #1737 moved the inset onto `.shell-members` and left ONE child out:
// `.members-pane` cancelled it with a negative `margin-inline` on its own rule
// and its rows re-declared 1rem of their own. So the radio band and the
// actions launcher sat at half a rem while the nick list above them sat at a
// full one, and the eye read the difference as a bug in the band. The query
// rail's heading — which the issue calls the members heading's twin, and which
// nobody had measured — was WORSE than either: `.rail-query-context` is an
// ordinary flow child INSIDE the rail's padding, so its heading's own 1rem
// stacked on the container's 0.5rem and the label rendered at one and a half.
//
// WHY E2E AND NOT VITEST, for the same reason `issue1737-rail-inset-and-band-
// restore` gives: this is RENDERED GEOMETRY, jsdom computes none of it, and a
// unit assertion could only restate the stylesheet. The SOURCE half — that the
// inset is DECLARED by the container and not merely rendered in the right
// place — is what `src/__tests__/railInset.test.ts` covers, because no
// measurement can see where a value was written. The two halves are disjoint
// on purpose: a child re-declaring the same 0.5rem by hand passes this file
// forever and fails that one.
//
// THE ORACLE READS THE TOKEN, IT DOES NOT SPELL IT. The expected gap comes
// from the container's own resolved `padding-left`, which IS `--rail-inset` in
// pixels as the engine computed it — so this stays green across a root
// font-size change and red the moment a surface stops agreeing with the rail.
// It could degenerate: if the container's padding vanished, the expected gap
// would become 0 and a fully full-bleed rail would satisfy the equality. The
// `> 0` assertion below is what forbids that, and it is not decoration.
//
// SURFACE vs INK, stated because the file mixes them. What the operator sees
// begin at an edge is the BORDER BOX for a child that paints one (the band's
// background and border-top, the actions drawer's border-top) and the GLYPHS
// for a child that paints nothing (a nick row is transparent, unbordered, and
// its hover is an underline — #1737). Measuring a nick row's border box would
// measure the full-bleed scroller it lives in and see nothing at all, which is
// precisely how this defect survived a year.
//
// FORM FACTOR: desktop chromium. `.resize-handle-right` is desktop-only by
// construction (Shell.tsx mounts it in the desktop branch alone), so its
// assertion has no phone counterpart to be missing. The inset rules themselves
// live on `.shell-members`, which both branches mount and neither overrides
// horizontally — the mobile block adds block-axis safe-area longhands only.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK: the radio stream is fulfilled from local bytes and
// the station logos are vendored, the same posture as the #682 and #1737
// specs, so a somafm.com outage cannot turn this red.
