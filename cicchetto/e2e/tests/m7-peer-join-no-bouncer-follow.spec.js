// M7 — peer JOIN on a channel that grappa is NOT bound to.
//
// Manual matrix: peer joins a random channel grappa has no presence
// in. Expected:
//   - grappa never sees the peer's JOIN (not a member of that channel)
//   - cicchetto sidebar gains NO entry for that channel
//
// The negative assertion needs a sync point: we have to know that any
// IRC activity from the peer that COULD have surfaced in cicchetto has had
// time to propagate. We do that by chaining a second JOIN to #spec-wN
// (where grappa IS) and waiting for THAT join event to render in cicchetto
// scrollback. Once that arrives, we know all earlier peer→IRC traffic
// (including the #other JOIN) has been processed by the leaf and
// either pushed by grappa or correctly ignored.
//
// CHANNEL_OUTSIDE is a fresh name for this spec (no autojoin row, no
// other test joins it). Each spec runs against a clean stack so cross-
// test contamination isn't a concern; the unique name is for grep-
// readability in trace failures.
