// #1764 — `.txt` and `.md` open in the media-viewer modal and are READ inline:
// monospace source, line numbers, nothing rendered.
//
// This asserts the VISIBLE OUTCOME, not the plumbing: that the words in the
// uploaded file are on screen and that the gutter numbers them. A spec that
// only proved "the modal exists" or "a function was called" would stay green
// through a viewer that opens empty, which is precisely the failure mode the
// CSP note below describes.
//
// ## Why the full upload vertical, and not a composed URL
//
// The text arm is the only viewer kind that FETCHES its bytes instead of
// pointing an element at them, so it answers to `connect-src` — `'self'` plus
// the captcha hosts and api.somafm.com, and deliberately NOT widened to
// `https:` the way `img-src`/`media-src` are. Running the real journey means
// the fetch crosses the e2e dumb proxy under the REAL prod CSP (the BEAM emits
// it via GrappaWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders; #485, pinned by
// nginx-csp-range-parity.spec.ts) with the `_cspGuard` fixture failing the spec
// on any `securitypolicyviolation`. Text on screen therefore proves BOTH that
// the bytes came back through the proxy AND that the policy admitted the read.
//
// It also exercises the `Range: bytes=0-…` request the viewer sends: the
// upload controller answers it with a 206 (`GrappaWeb.ByteRange`), and the
// viewer has to be as happy with a 206 as with a 200.
//
// ## Two phases, ONE journey each, in one test
//
// workers: 1 — a second `test()` is a second login + channel select for no
// coverage (the media-link-modal-viewer load-states precedent). The `.md`
// phase is not a duplicate of the `.txt` one: it is the phase that proves
// vjt's ruling ("nono nessun rendering di gesu, assolutamente solo il sorgente
// txt e md", #sbiffo 2026-08-24) survives contact with real markdown.
