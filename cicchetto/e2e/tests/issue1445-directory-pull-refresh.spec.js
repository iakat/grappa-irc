// #1445 — pulling the channel directory's row list down asks for a re-capture,
// and the spinner slot follows the finger on the way.
//
// WHAT THESE PROVE, and what they deliberately do not:
//
//   1. THE DOOR (chromium): a synthesized downward drag past the commit
//      distance puts the Refresh button into its "Refreshing…" state. The
//      outcome asserted is the visible one, not that a callback fired — and it
//      is visible precisely BECAUSE the pull goes through the same
//      `triggerRefresh` the button goes through, so it raises the same store
//      latch (F1). A gesture wired to a second refresh path would leave the
//      button reading "Refresh" and turn this red.
//   2. DISPLACEMENT (chromium): mid-drag, the browser's own computed matrix
//      says the TRACK has moved by exactly the finger's travel and by nothing
//      else. The reading is taken mid-gesture, which is only a stable number
//      because `pull-gesture-active` drops the snap-back transition — without
//      it getComputedStyle returns wherever the ease happened to be.
//      #1658 point 3 moved this reading off the slot and onto the track. The
//      slot no longer carries a transform of its own beyond the parked
//      `translateY(-100%)` in the stylesheet; what moves it is its ancestor.
//   2b. THE ROWS FOLLOW THE FINGER, AND THE SPINNER RIDES ABOVE THEM (#1658
//      point 3, chromium). Two assertions, and the first is the defect vjt
//      kept reporting: at a travel of 400px the first row's top edge sits well
//      below the list's top edge — the CONTENT moved, not just the spinner.
//      #1669 turned that reading from "by exactly 400px" into the pair of
//      inequalities its own section below sets out (past the commit distance,
//      short of the finger's 400), because the travel is damped now and an
//      equality with the finger's distance IS the defect #1669 removes.
//      Until point 3 only the slot moved, and because rows start at y=0 too,
//      every position where the spinner was visible was a position where it
//      covered the first row's top band; the strongest true statement
//      available then was the weaker "the slot never travels PAST the top
//      edge", and this file used to assert exactly that.
//      The second is the STRONG invariant that replaces it: the slot's bottom
//      edge lands ON the first row's top edge, never below it. It holds because
//      the two are one rigid body under one transform — an identity, not a
//      bound — so what this measures is that the ENGINE agrees with that
//      geometry once real layout exists, which jsdom cannot say.
//      Asserted at THREE root font sizes, with the slot height read alongside:
//      the slot is `2.5rem` against a size the user picks, and without the
//      height control three identical readings from a `--font-size` write that
//      silently failed would look like proof.
//   2c. NO PAINT AFTER THE COMMIT (#1658, chromium): the committing release
//      leaves no inline transform on the track and no inline opacity on the
//      slot. The binder does not call `onRelease` on that path, so the pane
//      clears the paint from `onCommit` — before that fix the spinner stayed
//      exactly where the finger left it, at full opacity, for the life of the
//      pane. Point 3 raised the stakes on it: the travel is on the TRACK now,
//      so the same omission would strand the whole channel list a hundred-odd
//      pixels down the pane, not just a spinner. Both elements are asserted,
//      and so is the slot's own transform staying empty — the pane must not
//      write one.
//   3. CSS CONTRACT (@webkit, iPhone 15): on the real target browser the row
//      container refuses its own overscroll (so the iOS rubber-band does not
//      fight the slot at the one scroll position the pull lives at) while
//      still declaring the ONE axis it can be panned on. Three POSITIVE
//      assertions, not one absence: `overscroll-behavior: none` alone would
//      also be satisfied by a container that had stopped scrolling
//      altogether, and the scroller's own `pan-y` alone would leave the ROW
//      — the hit-test target across nearly the whole list — still reading
//      `auto`, which is the shape #913 measured as insufficient.
//   3b. THE INVARIANT, RESOLVED BY THE ENGINE THE BUG CAME FROM (#1658 point
//      3, @webkit): a track translate of the SHAPE the pane writes — since
//      #1669 a fractional px value, see that test's own note — is
//      applied straight to the track and the engine's own geometry is read
//      back — did the ROWS move by it, and did the slot's bottom still land on
//      the first row's top?
//      The question is not the same one chromium answers, and that is why the
//      arm exists. The invariant is an identity only if the engine composes an
//      ancestor's px translate with the slot's OWN `translateY(-100%)` — a
//      PERCENTAGE that resolves against the slot's own height, not the
//      track's. Chromium composing it correctly says nothing about WebKit, and
//      a WebKit that resolved that percentage against the wrong box would put
//      the spinner back on top of the first row: the exact defect, on the only
//      engine the reporter has, with every chromium gate here GREEN. That is
//      the empty-green class — a gate that passes because it does not look
//      where the defect lives.
//      It used to ask a different question — whether WebKit resolved
//      `translateY(min(<px>, 100%))`, the mixed-unit cap. Point 3 deleted that
//      declaration from production, so the test was re-aimed rather than
//      dropped: the engine half is still worth a witness, only the geometry it
//      witnesses changed.
//      NO GESTURE, deliberately and not for convenience: `new Touch(...)` is
//      an `Illegal constructor` on Playwright's WebKit (measured; issue230's
//      header records the same limit for its own drag), so the production
//      gesture cannot be synthesized on that project at all. What 3b buys is
//      the ENGINE half; the PANE half — that the pane writes this declaration
//      from a real finger — is 2b's, on chromium. Each is honest about which
//      half it owns, and neither pretends to the other.
//      It carries a plain-px ARITHMETIC CONTROL ahead of the real reading,
//      because the first draft of it had none and measured the 150ms
//      snap-back transition instead of the resolved transform: every
//      declaration read as "parked" on BOTH engines and it looked like a
//      total WebKit failure. The control fails loudly in that state.
//
// NOT PROVEN ANYWHERE, on purpose rather than by omission:
//
//   * The FEEL, and with it the whole iOS question. A synthesized TouchEvent
//     drives no compositor and Playwright's webkit does not reproduce real iOS
//     scroll physics (feedback_playwright_webkit_not_ios_scroll). Nothing here
//     says the follow is smooth, that PULL_COMMIT_PX is the right distance, or
//     — the one that matters most — that iOS elects OUR gesture rather than
//     its own overscroll in the first place. The binder claims LATE, on a
//     touchmove, and on a real device the engine may have committed to a pan
//     before that claim lands. Test 3 asserts the CSS that is supposed to
//     prevent it; only a phone can say whether it does. That is a vjt call, as
//     it was for #213 and #1438.
//   * That Playwright's WebKit IS iOS Safari. Test 3b measures the same engine
//     family under a phone viewport, which is the closest thing reachable from
//     CI and strictly more than a chromium-only reading — it answers "does
//     WebKit compose an ancestor's px translate with a descendant's own
//     percentage offset such that the invariant holds", a question chromium
//     cannot answer at all. It does not answer "does it resolve the same way on
//     vjt's phone", and no assertion here claims it does.
//   * The TWO FEEL NUMBERS #1669 added — the damping factor and the ceiling.
//     They are declared provisional in `DirectoryPane.tsx` and vjt calibrates
//     them on a device; nothing in this file names either one, and nothing here
//     says the resistance feels like an iOS scroller. What test 3 asserts is
//     the visible PROPERTY: 400px of finger moves the rows by more than the
//     commit distance and by strictly LESS than 400 — damped, still following.
//     The curve's own guarantees (strictly increasing, gain never rising,
//     bounded by the ceiling) are properties of a number and are pinned over a
//     dense sweep in src/__tests__/DirectoryPane.test.tsx, where changing them
//     costs no testnet.
//     🔴 IOS PARITY, which the issue names as the acceptance bar, IS PROVEN
//     NOWHERE AND IS NOT CLAIMED. Playwright's webkit does not reproduce real
//     iOS scroll physics (the bullet above), so no reading in this file can
//     speak to it. That call is vjt's, on the phone.
//   * The GESTURE on WebKit, by anything here. `new Touch(...)` throws
//     `Illegal constructor` there, so no test in this file drives the binder
//     on that project. MEASURED while looking for a way round it, and recorded
//     because the next person will look too: `document.createTouch` DOES
//     exist and returns a usable Touch, `document.createEvent("TouchEvent")`
//     succeeds but has no `initTouchEvent`, and `new TouchEvent(type, {...})`
//     accepts a `document.createTouchList(...)` for its touch sequences while
//     rejecting a plain array with `TypeError: Type error`. So a WebKit drag
//     is reachable — nobody has built it, and whether the wiring half is worth
//     proving twice is a product call, not this file's.
//   * Interaction with the pane's scroll preservation. A progress ping that
//     lands WHILE a finger is down rewrites `scrollTop` from a queueMicrotask
//     (DirectoryPane's entry-count effect). Nothing here holds a finger across
//     a ping, and nothing here says what happens if one does.
//   * That the pull is DISCOVERABLE. The gesture is an addition; the button
//     and the stale CTA remain the discoverable paths, and no assertion here
//     is about a user finding it.
//
// The binder's decision table — which drags claim, which commit, which are
// left to native scroll — is unit-tested against a bare element in
// src/__tests__/pullGesture.test.ts, and the pane's wiring in jsdom in
// src/__tests__/DirectoryPane.test.tsx. These are the end-to-end doors.

// carried by the same transform as the spinner there was no collision left to
// bound — and the only use left was a drag MAGNITUDE (`PULL_COMMIT_PX * 3` in
// test 1), which reds only if the real constant grows past 240 and says
// nothing at all if it shrinks.
//
// #1669 gives it a witness again, of a different kind. The commit distance is
// now the SEAM of the travel curve: below it the finger goes through 1:1,

// It is still one-sided (drifting DOWN stays quiet), which is why the static
// witness below remains the pin that matters.
//
// What pins it is #1646's static witness, which needs no testnet:
