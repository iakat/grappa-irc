// #1062 — the far-behind ✓ is out of the float stack, and the × still works.
//
// This file replaces `issue997-far-behind-thumb-reach.spec.ts`, which pinned
// the OPPOSITE product: #997 mounted a second dismiss surface in the #280
// float stack and that spec measured its tap floor and its lower-right
// placement. vjt reported the cost from the mobile PWA: he navigates
// far-behind windows by repeated tapping of ONE zone, bottom-right —
// scroll-to-bottom while there is tail below, then the mobile next-active the
// instant it unmounts — and a third control with a third meaning landed under
// that thumb on exactly the windows the round trip is for.
//
// So the corner control is gone and the gesture is back to the bar alone. Two
// things are worth an e2e rather than a unit test, and both are here:
//
//   * the far-behind arm contributes NOTHING to the float stack. Asserted
//     against a real far-behind pane, because the arm only exists once the
//     resume has probed the gap and refused it — the state a unit test has to
//     fake;
//   * the × on the bar still drops the frozen badge. #997's spec was the only
//     e2e that clicked a dismiss and watched the badge fall; deleting it
//     outright would have quietly retired that outcome, so it moves here onto
//     the surviving door.
//
// NOT covered here, deliberately: that the next-active button takes over the
// corner once scroll-to-bottom unmounts. That is #280's coexistence claim, it
// has its own spec (`issue280-button-coexist.spec.ts`), and reproducing it
// needs a SECOND window seeded with unread on top of this file's 260-row
// far-behind seed — machinery whose failure modes would be about seeding, not
// about #1062. The third exit (leaving the window dismisses) is #1019's spec.
//
// Seeding mirrors the #997 spec it replaces (itself mirroring #947 and #693):
// the shared seeder plants 200 rows in #bofh and this needs unread > 200, so
// it re-seeds via the admin
// `resetSubject(baselineSeed)` surface. Nothing has to be undone afterwards:
// #1078 destroys the whole subject at teardown, rows and cursor with it.
//
// Desktop viewport, as the spec it replaces: the removal is a DOM claim, not a
// geometry one, and the sidebar badge is the clearer read of "the badge fell".
