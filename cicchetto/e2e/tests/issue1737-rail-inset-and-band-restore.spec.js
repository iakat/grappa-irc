// #1737 — two defects on the rail's now-playing band, and both need a BROWSER.
//
//   (a) the band sat flush against the rail edges while the `actions` launcher
//       below it was inset, so the two surfaces did not line up. vjt ruled the
//       cure is to move the horizontal inset onto the rail CONTAINER, with the
//       children at zero, rather than to give the band a matching value by
//       hand — one owner, one number, no drift between the rows.
//   (b) the band was inert except for its ⏹: tapping what is playing did not
//       bring back a transport the operator had hidden (#1697).
//
// WHY E2E AND NOT VITEST. (a) is RENDERED GEOMETRY. jsdom computes no layout —
// every `getBoundingClientRect()` there is zero — so a unit test can only
// assert that some declaration exists, which is a mirror of the stylesheet and
// would have passed just as happily before the fix. The whole defect is "these
// two boxes have different edges", and only a real engine has edges.
// (b)'s STATE half is pinned in `src/__tests__/RailRadio.test.tsx`; what is
// left for here is its GEOMETRIC half — that the restore control does not
// cover the ⏹, which is a hit-test and therefore also engine-only.
//
// THE ASSERTION IS A RELATION, NOT A NUMBER. It compares the band's edges with
// the launcher's rather than checking either against `0.5rem`. A pixel literal
// would re-encode the very value the fix just made single-source, and would go
// red on a root-font-size change that broke nothing. Measured on the defect:
// the band's border box started at the rail's inner edge and the launcher's
// started 0.5rem in, so the equality below is exactly what did not hold.
//
// FORM FACTOR, stated rather than implied: this runs on desktop chromium. The
// rule it proves lives on `.shell-members`, which both Shell branches mount
// and both form factors style from — the mobile drawer adds only `padding-top`
// / `padding-bottom` for the safe area, separate longhands from the
// `padding-inline` this asserts, so there is no shorthand for one to clobber
// the other with. The phone is not separately covered here.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK, for the reason the #682 spec spells out: the stream
// and the logos are served from local bytes, so a somafm.com outage cannot
// turn this red.
