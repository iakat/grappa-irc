// #1308 — the admin Sessions view lost the source address when #1157
// merged Visitors into it. What survived was one detail-panel fact,
// visitor-only, reading `visitors.ip`: identity-wide, written once when
// the visitor was provisioned, and with no user-side twin at all. A user
// row showed no address anywhere.
//
// vjt ruled it (2026-08-14): the fact is `accounts_sessions.ip`, the
// per-session one, it stays in the card, and the table grows no column.
// So the card is not a convenience here — it is the ONLY place this
// reaches an operator, at every width.
//
// jsdom already pins the fact list and the wire (`AdminSessionsTab.test.tsx`,
// `adminSubjectRows.test.ts`, the two controller wire tests). What only a
// real stack shows is that the value is REAL: it travels
// login → `accounts_sessions.ip` → one batched query → two row-backed
// endpoints → the merged row → the card. A jsdom fixture hands the
// renderer a string and proves none of that.
//
// The USER row is the discriminating half. Its card had no `ip` fact to
// begin with, so the label's mere presence there fails on the old code.
// The visitor half is a non-regression witness and nothing more: that
// card always rendered an address, and only the wire tests can tell
// WHICH address it is now.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: admin-gated EXEMPT.
