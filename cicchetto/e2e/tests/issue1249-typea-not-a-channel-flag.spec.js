// #1249 — a ban (CHANMODES type A) must never enter the channel's mode
// string. Setting `+b` used to grow the header indicator a `b`: a channel
// that is really `+nt` rendered as `+bnt`, because the server-side
// `channel_modes` cache treated every non-membership letter as a channel
// flag. The header is the user-visible face of that cache, so the fix is
// only proven here.
//
// The gesture is ONE token, `+bk <mask> <key>`, and that is deliberate:
//   - the `k` landing in the header is the barrier that the ircd accepted
//     and echoed the WHOLE token — without it, "no b in the header" would
//     also pass if the MODE had simply never arrived;
//   - the key reflected in the modal proves the dropped `b` still CONSUMED
//     its mask, so the arg list stayed aligned. A fix that skips the pop
//     keys the channel to `*!*@…` instead, and this is where that shows.
//
// vjt creates a fresh per-run channel (→ sole op, so the MODE is accepted
// and no peer is needed) and PARTs it in `finally`. jsdom/vitest cannot do
// this — it needs the live ircd MODE round-trip.
