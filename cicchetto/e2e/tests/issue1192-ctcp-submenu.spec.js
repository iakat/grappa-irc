// #1192 — the nick context menu's CTCP submenu.
//
// The machinery has been shipped since #591: `/ctcp` works typed, the server
// classifies the reply, the echo renders. What #1192 added is the way IN, so
// what has to be proven here is exactly the part jsdom cannot see — that a real
// right-click in a real browser reaches a real IRC peer.
//
// Three arms, each of which can fail on its own:
//
//   1. The drill-down. Clicking the group row replaces the item list with the
//      six verbs instead of invoking anything; the top level is gone and the
//      back row brings it back. The unit tests pin the mechanism against stubbed
//      rects — this pins that it survives the portal, the backdrop and the #487
//      measured placement in a browser that actually paints.
//   2. The wire. The peer itself witnesses `\x01VERSION\x01`. This is the arm
//      that makes the spec more than a DOM tour: a menu that opened beautifully
//      and dispatched nothing would pass every other assertion here.
//   3. The #640 shape. The echo lands in the SOURCE window and no query tab is
//      minted for the peer — a CTCP probe is a control surface, not the start
//      of a conversation.
//
// Untagged (chromium), like the #487 spec it shares a menu with: this is a
// right-click affordance, and the mobile long-press door onto the SAME shell is
// covered by #1067's spec.
