// GH #265 — the "jump to next active window" affordance (#235) counts
// MESSAGES only (PRIVMSG/NOTICE/ACTION), NOT presence churn
// (JOIN/PART/QUIT/NICK/MODE/TOPIC/KICK).
//
// Pre-#265 the activity gate fed on `selection.unreadCounts` (the TOTAL
// = messages + events), so a window with ONLY join/part spam or a mode
// flip lit the affordance even though nothing was said. #265 re-points
// the gate to `selection.messagesUnread` (content kinds only) — presence
// churn no longer inflates the count. This spec asserts the USER-VISIBLE
// outcome: the `.next-active-count` badge, driven by `activeWindowCount()`.
//
// Seeding produces exactly two unfocused windows on the seeded network:
//   * a DM (query) window  → ONE inbound PRIVMSG (content)  → MUST count
//   * #spec-wN                 → ONLY a peer JOIN (presence)    → MUST NOT count
// One peer drives both: it JOINs #spec-wN (presence-only — deliberately NO
// channel PRIVMSG) then PRIVMSGs the operator's nick to open the DM.
// Focus parks on the neutral $server window so neither accrues via focus.
//
// The event-only window is verified to have ACCRUED its event badge
// BEFORE the count is asserted — so the RED (gate on the total) fails on
// the COUNT VALUE ("Expected 1 Received 2"), never on a mis-seeded window
// or a missing-locator timeout. Under the total gate #spec-wN's `eventsUnread`
// bumps the count to 2; under the message-scoped gate it contributes 0.
