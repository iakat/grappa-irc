// #682 — internet radio: the picker is reachable from the RailActions drawer,
// picking a station drives the ONE audio element, and both surfaces name it.
//
// WHAT THIS SPEC ASSERTS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS AN OUTCOME AND NOT A MIRROR:
//   (a) the radio launcher is in the rail drawer and opens the picker — the
//       shape vjt decided, and the only door to the feature;
//   (b) the picker lists the curated stations;
//   (c) picking one puts THAT station's stream on the <audio> element and the
//       browser actually ISSUES the request for it (the route handler counts
//       the hits) — so this fails if the URL never reaches the element, which
//       a "the bar appeared" assertion alone would not catch;
//   (d) the docked transport shows the station's NAME. This is the assertion
//       that matters most on a phone: the rail carrying the chrome is a
//       drawer slid off-screen while playing, so the docked bar is the only
//       surface answering "what am I listening to";
//   (e) the rail's own station chrome names it too, and the picked row is
//       marked so the picker is not a blind list;
//   (f) #1739 — the artwork actually PAINTS, for a station that publishes a
//       logo and for one that publishes none, with no network of any kind
//       behind it. `naturalWidth > 0` and not merely a `src` attribute: an
//       <img> pointed at a 404 (or at the SPA's `index.html`, which is what a
//       missing `@cic_static_only` entry serves) carries exactly the same
//       `src` and draws the browser's broken glyph. #1739 removed the
//       `onError` handler that used to hide that, so the decoded width is the
//       only thing left that can tell the two apart;
//   (g) #1739 — and the picker issues NO cross-origin image request while it
//       does. That is the privacy outcome the issue was filed for, and it is
//       asserted as a count rather than inferred from (f) passing.
//
//       Counted on `resourceType() === "image"` and a foreign ORIGIN rather
//       than on a somafm URL pattern, because the invariant is host-agnostic:
//       the table already carries one row from another provider
//       (rockantenne.de) and the next one will come from somewhere nobody has
//       written down yet. A pattern-scoped count would go green for exactly
//       the station it had never heard of.
//
//       ⚠️ NOT "no request to api.somafm.com": the now-playing FEED lives on
//       that host and is a third-party URL by design (#1698, still true).
//       Measured before writing this — `nowPlaying.ts` fires `void poll(url)`
//       immediately on tune, not on the first interval — so a host-scoped
//       counter would have counted the feed and reddened on a leak that does
//       not exist. The image axis is the one #1739 moved.
//
// NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK. The stream is served by `page.route` from local
// bytes (fixtures/bytes `silentMp3`), so the suite never depends on somafm.com
// being up and a station outage cannot turn this red. The route is scoped to
// the station's real URL, so a change that stops requesting that URL still
// fails.
//
// The logos used to need the same treatment — "an <img> to a third party is
// still a third-party request", as this header put it — and #1739 removed the
// need rather than the request: `bun run sync:radio-logos` mirrors every
// station's bytes into `public/radio-logos/`, so the picker draws from our own
// origin. What was a stub is now an ABORT, so a regression both fails to paint
// (f) and shows up in the count (g) instead of one hiding behind the other.
//
// That abort also covers the now-playing feed, which this spec never routed
// and which therefore reached the real api.somafm.com on every run — a
// third-party dependency in a file whose header claims it has none. It is
// closed here rather than left, and nothing in this spec asserts a track.
//
// WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT, and where it IS asserted.
// The transport's LIVE mode — no seek slider, no download anchor, elapsed
// shown alone — is not checked here, and the omission is a platform limit
// rather than a gap left open. Live mode keys off a non-finite
// `HTMLMediaElement.duration`, and `route.fulfill` must serve a COMPLETE
// body, which is by definition finite: any stream this spec can serve
// deterministically reports a finite duration and takes the file branch.
// Serving a genuinely endless body would mean reaching a real Icecast host
// and reintroducing the external dependency this spec exists without. So
// live mode is pinned in `src/__tests__/AudioMiniPlayer.test.tsx`, which
// drives `duration` (Infinity and NaN) directly on the element. Weakening
// the assertion here to something a finite body could satisfy would have
// been a green that proves the opposite of what it claims.
