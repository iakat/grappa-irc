// #1796 — `/cycle [<channel>] [<message>]`: the CHANNEL bounce, irssi's CYCLE.
//
// Asserts the VISIBLE outcome of BOTH legs, in the window the operator typed
// in: a PART line carrying the message they typed, then a second self-JOIN
// line for the SAME channel, and a live sidebar row at the end.
//
// COUNTED, not merely matched. The testnet does not reset between specs and
// the scrollback is persistent, so #spec-wN already carries at least one
// self-JOIN line — and possibly several, since `cp15-b6-part-archive-rejoin`
// parts and re-joins the same channel. Each assertion is therefore "one MORE
// than the count this spec observed before it typed anything", which is
// order-independent and survives `--repeat-each`.
//
// The message is a bare sigil-less word ON PURPOSE: it is the #1208 trap.
// `/cycle brb` must part THIS window with the reason "brb" — not manufacture a
// channel named `brb` — and the cure is that `/cycle` shares `/part`'s parser
// arm rather than owning a second copy of the sigil rule. Under that
// regression the DELETE and the JOIN both go to a phantom `brb`, so BOTH
// counts below stay flat and both assertions fail. Asserting only the JOIN
// would pass with the part leg aimed anywhere.
//
// FOCUS is part of what is asserted, implicitly and deliberately: parting the
// focused window drops it from `channelsBySlug`, and selection.ts's UX-4
// bucket E picker moves focus off it. Both locators read the VISIBLE
// scrollback, so they only reach their counts once the join leg has put the
// operator back in the channel — which is the behaviour `cycleCommand`
// inherits from `joinCommand`.
//
// Cleanup: the spec's own end state IS the seed state (joined), so the
// afterEach is defensive — it only matters if the run died between the legs.
