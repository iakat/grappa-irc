// #1336 (M2, from #1117) — the positive control for the suite-wide CSP guard.
//
// `fixtures/test.ts`'s `_cspGuard` asserts, at the teardown of EVERY spec that
// imports the wrapped `test`, that zero `securitypolicyviolation` events were
// collected. That zero is the normal outcome, which is exactly what makes it
// dangerous: a collector that never receives produces the same empty array as
// a CSP nobody violated. Rename the exposed binding, land the init script
// after the document has already listened, or meet an engine that spells the
// event differently, and ~750 assertions go quiet together with nothing to
// show for it — the #1117 shape at its largest blast radius.
//
// So this spec provokes a REAL enforced block against the REAL header
// (`GrappaWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders`) and asserts the guard's own collector
// caught it, through the same binding, the same init script and the same
// array the teardown reads. It then drains what it provoked, so the guard's
// own assertion still sees the empty array it is entitled to.
//
// Placement, deliberate: ONE control per APPARATUS, not one per test. The
// wiring is a single fixture shared by every spec, so proving it live once
// per run is what a positive control on it can mean. It does NOT establish
// that the listener re-armed inside some other spec's context — a per-test
// control would cost a provoked violation in all ~750 of them, and any page
// with no enforced CSP (a bare `about:blank`, a document served by something
// other than the BEAM) would then fail for the harness's reasons rather than
// the product's.
//
// The stimulus is a `connect-src` violation: the CSP allowlist is `'self'`
// plus three named https hosts, so a fetch to a reserved-TLD host
// (RFC 2606 `.invalid`, which by construction never resolves) is refused by
// the policy before any network I/O — deterministic, side-effect free, and
// nothing in the app observes it. `.catch()` swallows the resulting
// TypeError: the rejected promise is the block working, not a failure.
import { expect, test } from "../fixtures/test";
// Reserved TLD (RFC 2606) — cannot resolve, so a violation here can only be
// the policy refusing it, never a network round trip that happened to fail.
