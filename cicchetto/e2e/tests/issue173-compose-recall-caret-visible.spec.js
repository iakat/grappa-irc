// #173 — after a compose HISTORY RECALL the caret must be VISIBLE. Recall
// (swipe up/down OR keydown ArrowUp/ArrowDown) swaps the controlled textarea
// `value` to a recalled line; the pure compose store (recallPrev/recallNext)
// only mutates the draft — it never touches the caret or the native scroll.
// So on a recalled line that OVERFLOWS the rows=1 textarea, the browser leaves
// scrollTop at 0 with the end-caret below the fold: you recall a long line and
// can't see where you're typing (the dogfood symptom, most reliably reached by
// a down-gesture, which by the #123 boundary mapping fires only while the
// textarea is atTop === scrollTop 0).
//
// The fix is the GENERAL rule "after any recall the caret is visible", routed
// through ONE ComposeBox helper from BOTH entry points: place the caret
// deterministically at the END of the recalled line (irssi history semantics)
// and scroll the textarea so that caret is in view. It is NOT a gesture-only
// band-aid — the keydown path shares the exact defect and the exact fix.
//
// GATE REALITY (feedback_playwright_webkit_not_ios_scroll): webkit playwright
// can't reproduce real iOS touch/scroll physics, so this is NOT the device
// gate — vjt dogfoods post-ship. What it CAN prove deterministically in
// chromium is the scroll-to-cursor GEOMETRY: after a recall the end-caret's
// line sits within [scrollTop, scrollTop+clientHeight]. The keydown case needs
// no touch synthesis at all (a real ArrowUp keydown), so it is the load-bearing
// deterministic guard; the gesture case reuses the #123 synthSwipe to prove the
// second call site is wired through the same helper. No hollow green: reverting
// the caret-scroll turns both red (scrollTop stays 0).
