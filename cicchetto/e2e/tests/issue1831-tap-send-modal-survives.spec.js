// issue 1831 — a modal opened from the compose line must survive the TAP that
// opened it.
//
// The claim under test is a PLATFORM one, which is why it cannot live in
// jsdom. `banlistCommand` has no `await` ahead of `openBanlistModal`, so the
// scrim is in the DOM before the browser dispatches the tap's compat mouse
// events. Those are synthesised after the touch ends and hit-tested against
// the layout as it stands THEN — so the click can land on a backdrop that did
// not exist when the finger went down, and a backdrop dismissing on any click
// dismisses in the gesture that opened it. The unit tests in
// BanlistModal.test.tsx DISPATCH that sequence; only an engine can be asked
// whether it PRODUCES it.
//
// It does. Measured here on chromium + touch, recording every event at the
// document in capture phase while tapping send with `/banlist` typed, against
// the PRE-CURE code:
//
//     pointerdown -> polygon              (the send button's arrow glyph)
//     touchstart  -> polygon
//     pointerup   -> polygon
//     mousedown   -> div.modal-backdrop   <- the scrim, mounted during pointerup
//     mouseup     -> div.modal-backdrop
//     click       -> div.modal-backdrop
//     …and the banlist modal count was 0.
//
// The press lands on the button and the click lands on the SCRIM. That is the
// defect, entire, on a real engine.
//
// 🔴 WHY THIS RUNS ON `chromium-pixel-touch` AND NOT ON `webkit-iphone-15`,
// which was tried first and is the wrong instrument. The same probe there
// records `pointerdown / touchstart / pointerup` and STOPS: no touchend, no
// mousedown, no mouseup, NO CLICK. Playwright's injected touch produces no
// compat mouse events on that engine at all, so a spec about what a
// synthesised click hits is unanswerable — and, measured, the pre-cure code
// went GREEN there on both arms. Do not "simplify" this back onto the webkit
// project: it passes without touching the defect.
//
// The pair below is deliberate, and the control is the load-bearing half:
//
//   * ENTER — the gesture the whole suite already uses (`composeSend` presses
//     Enter). A keydown synthesises no click, so this arm is green on both
//     sides of the cure; its job is to fail loudly if the STACK broke rather
//     than the mechanism.
//   * TAP — the same command through the send button. Red before the cure,
//     green after. Everything but the GESTURE is held fixed: same command,
//     same window, same bundle, same engine.
//
// That is also the local evidence bearing on the reporter's tab-vs-PWA
// asymmetry, which has never been shown to hold the gesture fixed. Here the
// gesture ALONE splits the outcome.
//
// PLATFORM LIMIT, stated rather than buried: the reported device is Android
// FIREFOX and this is Blink. Playwright's firefox does not support touch
// emulation, so Gecko is not reachable from this harness. This measures that
// an engine does it, and which gesture does it — not that Gecko does.
