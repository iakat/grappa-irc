// Issue #640 — /ctcp + /ping self-echo must land in the SOURCE window, and a
// CTCP query must NEVER open a query window for the target.
//
// Pre-#640 the outbound CTCP self-echo was a plain PRIVMSG addressed to the
// target: the server persisted it under the target's window AND auto-opened
// that window (#422 outbound-DM auto-open, server-side), while the RTT line was
// synthesised separately in the source window (subscribe.ts) — the two halves
// split across two windows, and pinging anyone (even a nonexistent nick) left a
// phantom query tab behind. #640 routes the echo to the SOURCE window with the
// wire recipient in meta.ctcp_target and skips the auto-open (server
// Session.send_ctcp / cic compose.ts).
//
// This is the acceptance gate per the issue: assert the USER-VISIBLE outcome —
// the echo (and, for a live peer, the RTT) render in the window the operator
// typed /ping in, and NO query window is opened for the target. jsdom cannot
// see any of this: it is the compose → REST → self-echo + reply → WS → render
// path against a real bahamut (feedback_ux_e2e_mandatory).
