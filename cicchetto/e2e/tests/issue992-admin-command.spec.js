// #992 — /admin [<target>] (RFC 2812 §3.4.4), the fourth member of the #127
// server-reply family (/info, /version, /motd). The reply is buffered
// server-side and drained as ONE typed `server_reply` event with source
// "admin", rendered as the shared ServerReplyModal — never dumped into
// scrollback.
//
// WHY this e2e exists and what only it can see. Every claim in #992's design
// was read out of the bahamut C source (`m_admin`, `src/s_serv.c:2676`) — the
// four-terminator set (256-259 / 423 / 402 / 447) was DERIVED, never observed.
// Until this spec ran, not one real ADMIN numeric had ever crossed a socket in
// this repo. The unit tests pin the wiring against synthesised messages; this
// pins it against an ircd that actually answers.
//
// The two asserts that discriminate, rather than mirror:
//
//   1. The 259 line is PRESENT in the modal. RPL_ADMINEMAIL is NOT the
//      RPL_ENDOFMOTD-shaped pure terminator it is often mistaken for: its
//      format is `":%s 259 %s :%s"` fed `aconf->name` (`s_err.c:297`), the
//      contact address — the single most useful line of the reply. A design
//      that treated 259 as a bare terminator would still show a modal, still
//      show lines, and still pass a "modal appeared" test — while silently
//      dropping the address. Asserting the testnet's A-line email
//      (`root@leaf4.azzurra.chat`, `infra/bahamut/conf.leaf4.tmpl` field 3 →
//      `aconf->name`) is what tells the two designs apart.
//
//   2. `/admin <unknown-server>` surfaces a 402. A BARE `ADMIN` can only ever
//      yield 256-259 or 423 — it can NEVER produce ERR_NOSUCHSERVER, which
//      comes from `hunt_server()` on a target grappa had to put on the wire.
//      So a surfaced 402 is unforgeable proof the target argument survived
//      cic's parser, the channel door, and `Client.send_admin/2`. It also
//      exercises the shared 402 owner clause (`@server_reply_402_owners`):
//      with only `admin_pending` armed, the error must surface as "admin".
//
// NOT covered here, and deliberately so: 423 ERR_NOADMININFO needs a leaf with
// NO A: line, and 447 ERR_RESTRICTED needs a restricted-class user. Neither is
// reachable without reshaping the shared testnet, so both stay unit-tested
// against synthesised numerics in test/grappa/session/event_router_test.exs.
//
// Server-side threading (client wire, channel target validation, EventRouter
// accumulate + drain, 402 ownership) is unit-tested in
// test/grappa/irc/client_test.exs, test/grappa_web/channels/grappa_channel_test.exs
// and test/grappa/session/event_router_test.exs. The parser + compose plumbing
// is unit-tested in cicchetto/src/__tests__/{slashCommands,compose}.test.ts.
