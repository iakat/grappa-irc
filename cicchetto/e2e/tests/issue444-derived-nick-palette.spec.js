// #444 — nick palette widened from 16 to 32 render buckets. The theme
// still AUTHORS only 16 hues (`--nick-color-0..15`); cic DERIVES buckets
// 16..31 in CSS from those 16 via `color-mix(in oklab, var(--nick-color-k),
// var(--fg) 38%)` (a tone shift toward the foreground), so the render
// palette doubles with zero server / theme-token / migration change.
//
// Why this e2e exists (and why the unit test is NOT enough): jsdom is
// CSS-cascade-blind and does NOT compute `color-mix` (per
// `feedback_cicchetto_browser_smoke`). The unit test in
// `src/__tests__/nickColor.test.ts` can only assert that a
// `--nick-color-N` DECLARATION exists in `default.css` — it cannot prove
// the declaration RESOLVES to a real colour at render time. That gap is
// exactly the failure mode #444 must not ship: `NickText` renders
// `color: var(--nick-color-N)` with NO fallback, so a bucket that fails to
// resolve is invalid-at-computed-value-time and the nick silently inherits
// `--fg` (uncoloured). Only a real browser exercises the `var()` +
// `color-mix` resolution. This spec pins it.
//
// vjt constraint verified here: the derivation must hold on BOTH shipped
// themes (irssi-dark — light `--fg` on a dark `--bg`; mirc-light — black
// `--fg` on white). A band that fails to resolve, or collapses onto the
// authored band, on either theme is a regression. Colour AESTHETICS (the
// 38% figure, the exact hues) are vjt's to eyeball post-deploy and are NOT
// asserted here — only that every bucket resolves to a distinct, real
// colour on both themes.
//
// The probe injects NickText-shaped nodes at the document level and reads
// their computed colour — the same technique the sibling
// `ux-5-bc2-nick-render.spec.ts` uses for the distinct-nick assertion.
// Driving real IRC traffic is unnecessary: the CSS cascade under test is
// identical, and a document probe keeps the assertion deterministic.
