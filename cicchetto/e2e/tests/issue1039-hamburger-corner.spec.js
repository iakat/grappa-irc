// @webkit — #1039. The mobile ☰ rail opener must land on the SAME pixel on
// every window kind, so switching windows never moves the one door into the
// rail.
//
// The defect: two containers host that one control. On a channel it is a flex
// child of `.topic-bar`, placed by the bar's own `padding: 0.5rem 1rem`; on
// every other kind it is #985's float, placed by `margin: 0.25rem 0.5rem`.
// Both anchor to the same box — `.shell-main` → `.drop-upload-zone` (no
// padding) → `.topic-bar` on one side, `.shell-main` → `.shell-chrome` on the
// other — so the two offsets are directly comparable, and they disagreed:
// 0.25rem higher and 0.5rem further right on a non-channel window.
//
// Why an e2e and not a vitest: the defect IS rendered geometry, and the two
// hosts are different elements in different subtrees — no unit can compare
// where they land. jsdom has no layout engine. The SOURCE-level half (both
// rules reading one token, so they cannot drift apart again) is pinned in
// `src/__tests__/hamburgerCorner.test.ts`; what only a real engine answers is
// whether the two rectangles actually coincide.
//
// Mobile-only by construction (`ShellChrome` mounts only in Shell's
// `isMobile()` branch, and `.topic-bar-hamburger` is `display: none` above
// 768px), so this runs on webkit-iphone-15 alone — the @webkit tag; the
// chromium project grepInverts it.
//
// The third host used to be the open question here: `.admin-pane-header`
// (#1033, 2026-08-07) put the same ☰ at the pane's top-LEFT, deliberately,
// because the top-right corner was taken by its close × and refresh. #1073
// settled it by deleting the disagreement rather than unifying an offset — the
// admin pane now renders `.topic-bar` itself, so its ☰ is the same trailing
// child measured below and lands in the same corner by construction. No arm is
// added here for it: this spec's two hosts differ in their BOX (a floated
// zero-height row vs a real band), which is the thing that could drift apart,
// and admin is no longer a third box.
//
// Parity matrix per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: this is a UI shape
// contract, subject-shape-agnostic. The registered seed suffices.
