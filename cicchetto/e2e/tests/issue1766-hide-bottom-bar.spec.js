// GH #1766 — a per-user setting that hides the mobile BottomBar.
//
// vjt, `#grappa` 2026-08-25: *"aggiungiamo setting toggle per disattivare la
// bottom bar su mobile. ora sono su 7 reti ed e' diventata praticamente
// inutile"*. The bar is a flat horizontal strip of EVERY window across EVERY
// network — O(windows), not O(screens) — so past a handful of networks it is
// longer than the useful scroll distance and the picker stops picking.
//
// Default stays ON. #174 closed with the ruling that the bar must NOT be
// deleted, only made opt-in from settings; #71's second ruling reversed "kill
// the mobile bottom bar" outright. This is the opt-out those two asked for.
//
// ## What this file has to prove that the unit tests cannot
//
// The unit suite pins the JSX gate and the child order in jsdom, where there is
// no layout, no service worker, no server and no second page load. Three claims
// need a real browser and a real bouncer:
//
//   1. The bar actually LEAVES the phone. A `<Show>` that renders nothing in
//      jsdom still tells you nothing about a strip that is `position`-ed by a
//      stylesheet jsdom never applies.
//   2. Something navigable replaces it. That is the whole reason the ☰ ships
//      with the toggle: #1041's left-edge swipe is gesture-only with zero
//      affordance, which is the drawer-only navigation #71 refused as a
//      default. So the test does not stop at "the ☰ is in the DOM" — it taps
//      it and CHANGES WINDOW through the drawer it opens. A ☰ that renders and
//      navigates nowhere would pass a presence assertion.
//   3. The preference is ACCOUNT-scoped, not device-scoped. It sits in the
//      #449 synced `display_prefs` and not in localStorage alone, deliberately
//      and against the counter-precedent of its own neighbour in the settings
//      fieldset (#914's per-device `hide_next_active`). Only a round trip
//      through the server can tell the two apart, so the second test wipes the
//      local mirror and reloads: if the bar comes back, the pref was never
//      synced and the "7 networks is an account property" argument was not
//      implemented.
//
// `@webkit` throughout: the bar renders on the mobile branch only, so a
// chromium run would assert the absence of something that was never there.

// in a `::before` + two `box-shadow` copies that no rect API reports at all.

//
// Scanned 4px inside each button so the 1px border is out of frame — a
// decoration is not ink (and at 48px box vs ~20px glyph there is 14px of
// clearance a side, so the inset cannot clip what we came to measure). The
// background is taken as the most frequent colour in the scanned region rather
// than sampled from a corner, so a theme background image cannot fake ink.
