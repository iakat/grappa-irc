// #1244 — what the admin console spends VERTICALLY on a phone, after
// #1223 bought its horizontal budget by stacking every label above its
// value.
//
// vjt, retesting `e0ef575c` on a 440px iPhone: *"every fact now stacks
// its label above its value, so a three-fact card is six rows where three
// would do"* — `VISITORS` / `0/∞`, `USERS` / `1/3`, `PER-IP` / `5`, two
// full rows each to print four characters, and the same again for `LAST
// SEEN` / `CHANNELS` / `ACTIONS` on the session card below.
//
// The layout that answers it has TWO branches, and both are asserted here
// because a fix that only did one of them would be the previous round
// again in the other direction:
//
//   short — the label and its value share one line, label at the card's
//     left edge, value flush with its right one. This is the row that was
//     costing two.
//   long — a value whose content does not fit beside its label moves to
//     the next line, where it is alone and starts at the card's left edge
//     with the full width to wrap into. This is #1223's stacked layout,
//     kept for the values that need it.
//
// 🔴 These two branches are the successor to two #1223 asserts, by vjt's
// ruling on this issue (2026-08-12): *"'the four asserts from #1223 stay
// green' was shorthand for do not regress the horizontal budget, not keep
// those literal thresholds"*. `a card value starts at the card's edge`
// (`indent <= 2` on every labelled cell) and `a detail fact gives its
// value the panel's full width` (`dd` under `dt`, `dd >= 0.85 * table`)
// both encode the stacked layout as the ONLY correct answer, which is
// what the issue reverses. They become the LONG branch below, and the
// short branch gets the new claim. The two tests they came from carry a
// pointer to here rather than a weakened threshold, so nobody has to
// reconstruct which of the two rounds is current.
//
// What does NOT move: nothing in the console may overflow the viewport
// horizontally (`ux-6-g-admin-mobile-h-scroll`, with the single named
// `.adm-nav` exemption vjt restored on the same retest), no panel value
// may be broken mid-token, and the detail panel still fills its cell.
// Those are the horizontal budget, and this issue is not allowed to
// spend it.
//
// Measured at 393px AND 440px. 393 is the width every other admin guard
// runs at and the one the h-scroll oracle is calibrated to; 440 is the
// device vjt actually reported from, and the two are far enough apart
// that a value can fit beside its label at one and not at the other. A
// fix proven at one width is not proven at his.
//
// Per `feedback_e2e_user_class_parity_matrix`: admin-gated, the EXEMPT
// shape — non-admin cannot reach this surface at all.
