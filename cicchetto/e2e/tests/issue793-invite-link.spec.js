// #793 — a shareable invite link, `irc.sindro.me/?go=<network>/<channel>`, is
// a URL you can paste to a normal person: they click it, they are ASKED, and
// they land in the channel.
//
// What is proven here is the user-visible chain, end to end against the live
// bahamut-test leaf, not the existence of a parser:
//   1. Opening the app AT the invite URL pops the shared ConfirmModal naming
//      the channel; confirming JOINs it and switches to the window. The
//      address bar is left clean once the invite is spent, so a refresh does
//      not re-fire it.
//   2. An invite to a channel we are already in switches straight there with
//      NO modal (#648's rule: asking to join an open window is noise).
//   3. An invite naming a network this account has not bound joins nothing
//      and says so — the branch #793 leaves open (cross-user network
//      identity) must be a visible dead end, never a silent one.
//
// `?go=` is a query param on `/`, deliberately: vjt asked for it in those
// words so an invite could never collide with a client route. The first
// shipment used `/<network>/<channel>` instead and had to keep a denylist of
// reserved first segments to stay out of `/share`'s way. Nothing here
// depends on the path any more, which is the property that made the denylist
// unnecessary.
