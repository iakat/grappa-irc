// #1702 — Media Session metadata: the OS is told what is playing.
//
// THE DEFECT: on an iOS lock screen the radio showed "Cicchetto" and nothing
// else — no station, no track, no artwork. `navigator.mediaSession` was never
// set anywhere in cic, so the OS fell back to the manifest's app name.
//
// 🔴 WHY THIS SPEC IS `@webkit` AND NOT THE DEFAULT CHROMIUM PROJECT. The bug
// is an iOS lock screen. A green on desktop Chrome would be a green OFF the
// defect's platform, which proves the code ran somewhere rather than that it
// works where it failed. The suite already has the right project —
// `webkit-iphone-15`, WebKit on an iPhone 15 device profile — and Playwright
// 1.59.1's WebKit was measured to implement the whole API before this spec was
// written: `navigator.mediaSession`, the `MediaMetadata` constructor,
// `setActionHandler`, `playbackState`, and read-back of every metadata field.
// So the platform gap is closed, not papered over.
//
// WHAT REMAINS OUT OF REACH, stated rather than hidden: that iOS actually
// RENDERS on its lock screen what WebKit was handed is not observable from any
// browser automation. That is a device check and it stays one. What this spec
// does buy is the same engine, an iPhone device profile, and an assertion on
// the exact API the OS reads — which is the whole of what cic controls.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each is an outcome rather than a mirror:
//   (a) metadata EXISTS at all — the regression guard for the defect itself,
//       which was precisely that it was always null;
//   (b) the FIELD MAPPING: `title` is the TRACK, `artist` its artist, `album`
//       the STATION. The issue as filed asked for `title` = station with the
//       track fed into `artist`/`album`; taken literally that buries the track
//       on the primary line, leaving half the original complaint standing. The
//       platform convention won, and it is already this repo's spelling in
//       `nowPlayingLine`. This assertion is what pins that decision;
//   (c) the artwork mime is READ off the logo URL — `groovesalad` is a `.png`
//       and 10 of the table's 14 rows are `.jpg`, so a hardcoded mime would
//       ship wrong for either group. #1696 is the issue that lesson came from;
//   (d) the lock-screen transport drives THE SAME element the in-app bar does.
//       Asserted by capturing the registered handlers and invoking `pause`,
//       then checking the element actually stopped — a registration count
//       alone would pass with the handlers pointed at nothing.
//
// 🔴 NO THIRD-PARTY NETWORK, AND `page.route` IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE FEED.
// Measured, not assumed: with the feed on `page.route` this spec reached the
// REAL api.somafm.com and the lock screen came back naming "Kaya Project —
// Desert Phase (Hibernation Remix)" instead of the canned track below.
//
// cic ships a Workbox service worker (`VitePWA`, `registerType: "autoUpdate"`),
// and Playwright does not intercept requests that pass through a service
// worker — only ones the page issues directly. The `<audio>` stream is a media
// load that does not go through it, which is why #682's stream intercept works
// and hides the problem; the now-playing `fetch()` does, and escaped. It is
// also a RACE rather than a constant: the worker only intercepts once it has
// CLAIMED the page, so a spec touching a third party early
// (`issue1695-somafm-connect-src-perimeter`) is intercepted fine, while this
// one runs after a login, a channel select and a rail interaction.
//
// The cure is to stub `window.fetch` ABOVE the worker instead, which is what
// `addInitScript` below does. `serviceWorkers: "block"` was tried first and
// REJECTED: cic then honestly raises "Service worker registration failed —
// Offline mode and push notifications are unavailable", whose banner both
// intercepts the rail click and means the spec would be exercising a degraded
// app. Stubbing at the app's own boundary keeps the worker real and still
// spends nothing on the network.
