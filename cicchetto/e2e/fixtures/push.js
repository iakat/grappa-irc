// Push-notifications e2e helpers — push notifications cluster B5
// (2026-05-14).
//
// Three concerns:
//
//   1. **Stub `pushManager.subscribe`** so the install-path spec can
//      complete the cic enablePush() dance without a real push vendor
//      registration. The real W3C `pushManager.subscribe` would
//      contact FCM / Mozilla autopush and fail in the integration
//      stack (no external network, no valid VAPID-public-key
//      registration with a vendor). The stub returns a
//      PushSubscription-shaped object whose `endpoint` points at the
//      push-catcher sidecar — cic POSTs that endpoint to
//      /push/subscriptions, server stores the row, and B2's
//      Push.Sender then routes to push-catcher.
//
//   2. **Grant / clear notification permission** at the BrowserContext
//      level so cic's `Notification.requestPermission()` short-
//      circuits to "granted" / "denied" without an OS dialog.
//
//   3. **Push-catcher REST client** for spec-side polling of "did a
//      Sender POST land for subscription <id>?". Mirrors
//      grappaApi.assertMessagePersisted's poll-with-timeout shape.
//
// Why a single helper module + page-level initScript stub instead of
// per-spec inline setup: each push-trigger spec opens a fresh
// BrowserContext, completes the same `loginAs + enablePush + assert
// catcher` sequence, and tears down by resetting catcher state. The
// helper lifts that ritual into one call site so the specs read like
// "operator enables push, peer mentions, catcher saw a body".
//
// Boundaries with cicchettoPage.ts: this module owns push-specific
// glue (initScript, permissions, catcher REST). Window-state
// assertions, scrollback queries, channel selection still come from
// cicchettoPage.ts — push specs use both.
