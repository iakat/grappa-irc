// #348 — "is <nick> away RIGHT NOW", as one correlated WHOIS round-trip.
//
// WHOIS is request/response and always ends in `318 RPL_ENDOFWHOIS`, so a
// reply that completes WITHOUT a `301 RPL_AWAY` is a POSITIVE statement of
// "present". Watching the line stream for a 301 instead cannot say that: it
// only ever reports "I heard nothing", which is equally what a peer killed
// by bahamut's per-IP limits, a reply stuck behind the fake-lag bank, and a
// nick that never registered all produce. A spec asserting "still not away"
// over a window is otherwise satisfied by silence — so silence must not be
// able to be a verdict.
//
// Both failure modes REJECT rather than resolving false, because "not away"
// is precisely the wrong thing to tell a caller here:
//   * no 318 inside the budget — the peer asked and nobody answered;
//   * `401 ERR_NOSUCHNICK` — nobody by that nick is on the network (e.g. the
//     bouncer registered a suffixed nick after a collision), so the reply
//     says nothing about the session under test.
//
// Lives in its own module, free of the e2e-only `irc-framework` dependency
// and reached through a structural source, for the reason `privmsgWait.ts`
// gives: the instrument a claim is judged by has to be provable itself, and
// that means unit-testable under the cic vitest project without a testnet.
// The numeric of a WHOIS reply line that is ABOUT `nick`, or null.
//
// Server numerics are `:<prefix> <numeric> <requester> <subject> …`, so the
// subject is read off field 3 rather than regex-matched anywhere in the line:
// a 301's away message is FREE TEXT and can hold a nick, a numeric, or both,
// and a spec whose oracle can be flipped by what somebody typed after `/away`
// is not an oracle. Nick comparison is exact `===`, the convention every
// other predicate in `ircClient.ts` already uses (`event.nick === this.nick`)
// — bahamut is CASEMAPPING=ascii and echoes the nick as it holds it, and a
// spelling that somehow differed surfaces as a LOUD unanswered-WHOIS rather
// than as a quiet wrong answer.
