// #1336 — the absence assertion is the instrument seven push specs are judged
// by, so it has to be able to FAIL for the right reason. Runs under the cic
// vitest project (same reason, same shape as `scrollGesture.test.ts` and
// `whoisWait.test.ts`): the logic is deliberately free of `fetch`, so it is
// provable without a testnet.
//
// The case that matters is the one MEASURED on #1152: the peer's DM never
// reached grappa at all (0 occurrences of the peer nick in a 240 MB
// `grappa-test.log` that carried 135 902 message INSERTs, so the instrument
// was sound). On the POSITIVE spec that event was a loud 5 s timeout. On an
// absence assertion the very same event is a silent PASS — the suppression
// under test is never exercised, and nobody finds out.
